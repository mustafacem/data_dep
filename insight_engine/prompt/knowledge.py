Article 1:
Alki David, heir to the Coca-Cola bottling fortune, has vowed to ignore a $900 million judgment against him for sexual assault, marking his fifth major legal defeat for alleged misconduct. David claims that none of the plaintiffs will ever receive their due payments. Despite the ruling, collecting the judgment may be difficult as the presiding judge is currently on vacation and has not signed off on it yet. David, who has a history of legal issues including battery and harassment, was accused in the recent case of rape and creating a hostile work environment. He disputed the jury's decision, alleging procedural unfairness and attacking the MeToo movement. David's former attorney acknowledged the judgment but criticized the process and the portrayal of David as a billionaire. David's controversial behavior includes derogatory remarks and crude acts in the workplace.

The Coca-Cola Company operates with a complex matrix organizational structure that includes geographic divisions, product divisions, business-type units, and functional groups. This structure is designed to manage its vast global operations efficiently.

**Key components of Coca-Cola's organizational structure:**

1. **Geographic Divisions:** Coca-Cola is divided into four main geographic segments: 
   - Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA)
   - Latin America
   - North America
   - Asia Pacific

2. **Business-Type Units:** There are two primary non-geographic divisions:
   - Global Ventures (GV): Manages acquired brands and new investments.
   - Bottling Investments Group (BIG): Handles company-owned bottling operations.

3. **New Business Units (Introduced in 2021):** Nine new units were established to reduce resource duplication and expedite product introductions. These units are also geographically based, including regions like North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, Eurasia and Middle East, Japan and South Korea, Greater China, ASEAN and South Pacific, and India and Southwest Asia.

4. **Product-Based Divisions:** Coca-Cola’s portfolio of about 200 brands is managed through categories such as:
   - Coca-Cola
   - Sparkling Flavors
   - Hydration, Sports, Coffee and Tea
   - Nutrition, Juice, Dairy, and Plant
   - Emerging

5. **Functional Groups:** Specialized groups based on skill sets and expertise support global operations. These include departments like Marketing, Finance, HR, Investor Relations, Global Community Affairs, and Technical and Innovation.

**Operational Reporting:** Leaders of geographic divisions, business-type units, and product categories report to the President and COO. Each product-based category is led by a President who reports directly to the Chief Marketing Officer.

**Comparison with Competitors:**
- **PepsiCo:** Uses a mixed structure with both geographic and product-based divisions.
- **Nestlé:** Employs a matrix structure with geographic and product divisions.
- **Dr Pepper Snapple Group:** Previously used a more centralized functional structure before its acquisition by Keurig Green Mountain.

**Implications:**
- **Market Adaptation:** Coca-Cola’s geographic focus allows for strong local market presence and responsiveness to consumer preferences.
- **Innovation:** Competitors like PepsiCo and Nestlé, with their mixed structures, might offer a broader landscape for product innovation.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Coca-Cola’s structure may face challenges in global strategic alignment and efficiency compared to more centralized models.

Overall, Coca-Cola’s organizational structure aims to balance global integration with local responsiveness, managing a diverse and extensive product portfolio effectively across various regions.

Baltimore has initiated a lawsuit against major plastic producers such as PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, accusing them of deceptive practices and contributing to public nuisance by creating extensive plastic waste. The lawsuit claims that these companies knowingly allowed plastic waste to pollute the environment and burdened the city with cleanup costs amounting to tens of millions of dollars annually. This legal action is part of a growing trend of plastics litigation aimed at holding manufacturers accountable for environmental and public health damages. The city is seeking financial compensation and punitive damages to cover cleanup efforts. The case is among the first of its kind in the U.S., potentially setting a precedent for other cities to follow.

Coca-Cola continues to operate in Russia despite previous pledges to exit the market following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. Coca-Cola HBC, in which the US company holds a 21% stake, still produces drinks through Multon Partners, which launched Dobry Cola—a product similar to Coca-Cola—in Russia. This drink has become the most popular soda in Russia, capturing 13% of the market. Additionally, Russia imports Coca-Cola from neighboring countries like Georgia and Kazakhstan.
PepsiCo, another major player, also claimed to cease operations in Russia but introduced a new cola, Evervess, resulting in a 12% profit increase. Both companies face challenges in leaving the Russian market due to the Kremlin's demands for significant exit taxes and asset seizures.
This situation highlights the difficulty for companies in making a complete exit from Russia while inadvertently supporting the country's economy during its ongoing conflict with Ukraine.
