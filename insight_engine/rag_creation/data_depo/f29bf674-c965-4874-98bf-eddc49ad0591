Liquidity

The short-term rating is 'A-1+', derived from the long-term rating on Siemens AG. We regard Siemens' liquidity as exceptional, with an expectation that liquidity sources will continuously exceed uses by 2x over the next 24 months from the end of September 2023. We further view Siemens' bank relationships as well established, its credit market standing as high, and its financial risk management as very prudent.

We estimate that principal liquidity sources include:

- Reported cash and cash equivalents of about â‚¬11.3billion at the end of September 2023.
