The Supervisory Board has issued Bylaws for the Managing Board that contain the assignment of different portfolios and the rules for cooperation both within the Managing Board and between the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board as well as rules for the socalled Equity Investments. In accordance with these Bylaws, the Managing Board is divided into the portfolio of the President and CEO and a variety of Managing Board port folios. The Managing Board members responsible for the individual Managing Board portfolios are defined in a business assignment plan that is determined by the Supervisory Board. As the Managing Board member with responsibility for the People & Organization port folio, the Labor Director (Arbeitsdirektor) is appointed in accordance with the requirements of Section 33 of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz, MitbestG). When making recommendations for the first time appointments of Managing Board members, it is to be taken into account that the terms of these appoint ments shall not, as a rule, exceed three years.
