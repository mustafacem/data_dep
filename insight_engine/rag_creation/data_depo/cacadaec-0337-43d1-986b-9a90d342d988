Compliance indicators and whistle-blowers Our employees use our reporting channels regularly. A total

of 416 compliance cases that required an inquiry or investi- gation were reported in fiscal 2023. We believe that the increase in compliance cases from the previous year falls within the range of normal fluctuation. The total number of disciplinary measures imposed for compliance violations was 166 in fiscal 2023.

The number of disciplinary measures in a fiscal year does not necessarily reflect the number of compliance cases reported in the same period. This is because disciplinary action may not be taken in the same year as the case was reported or when the investigation was completed. Furthermore, one compliance case may result in multiple disciplinary actions or none at all.
