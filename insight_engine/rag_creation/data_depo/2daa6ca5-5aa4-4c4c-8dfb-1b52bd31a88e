8.2.3 Risk management organization and responsibilities

To oversee the ERM process and to further drive the integration and harmonization of existing control activities to align with legal and operational requirements, the Managing Board established a Risk Management and Internal Control Organization, led by the Head of Assurance. In order to allow for a meaningful discussion at the Siemens Group level, this organization aggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature into broader risk and opportunity themes. This aggregation naturally results in a mixture of risks, including those with a primarily qualitative assessment and those with a primarily quantitative assessment; the same applies to opportunities. Accordingly, we do not adopt a purely quantitative assessment of risk and opportunity themes. Thematic risk and opportunity assessments as well as our risk-bearing capacity then form the basis for the evaluation of the company-wide risk and opportunity situation during the quarterly Managing Board meetings. The Head of Assurance assists the Managing Board with the operation and oversight of the risk and internal control system and reporting to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
