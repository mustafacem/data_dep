Actions and results

Energy management and energy efficiency For energy-intensive units, we adhere to the ISO 50001

standard, which aims to ensure the effective management of energy consumption in our operations. Currently, 45 Siemens sites have implemented energy management systems com- pliant with ISO 50001. This also requires our sites to conduct regular internal and external energy and carbon audits.

To calculate energy efficiency, we analyze our energy con- sumption in relation to sales development. Due to reduced energy usage by 9.1% and a growth in sales, we increased our energy efficiency by 39%1 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2021.
