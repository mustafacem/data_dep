Resource efficiency & circularity Through their use of our digital technology, our customers

can achieve resource efficiency and profitability. For instance, we harness digitalization to reduce the require- ments of physical assets and resources. We combine the real and the digital worlds with our digital twin technology, a virtual representation of a physical product or process that is used to simulate, predict, and optimize its physical counter- part. Digital twins enable users to do more with fewer resources and make current and future environmental foot- prints transparent. Our building solutions also contribute to optimized space utilization and ultimately increase resource efficiency. Our mobility solutions focus on enhanced network capacity and extended lifecycles.
