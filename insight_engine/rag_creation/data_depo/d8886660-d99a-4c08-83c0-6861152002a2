Overall, markets served by Smart Infrastructure grew clearly in fiscal 2023. Market dynamics were influenced by a further recovery from COVID-19-related effects; easing of supply chain and logistics constraints, which resulted in shorter lead times for order fulfillment; strong price inflation; and effects from the war in Ukraine. Furthermore, rising interest rates burdened building construction markets. On a geographic basis, all reporting regions contributed to growth. Price inflation affected all regions and was particularly high in the U.S. While on the one hand rising interest rates impacted growth in the U.S., economic activity was boosted by stimulus programs on the other hand. In China, the recovery from lockdown measures was significantly weaker than expected, which also impacted growth dynamics in other countries, while Europe was most strongly affected by the war in Ukraine and high energy prices. Grid markets grew clearly, driven by demand for integration of energy from renewable resources. Industrial markets also grew clearly on strong demand in the battery, semiconductor, and automotive industries. The buildings market overall also grew but activity in the commercial building market rose only moderately. In fiscal 2024, markets served by Smart Infrastructure are expected to grow clearly but at a slower pace than in fiscal 2023 due to a substantially lower effect from price inflation and a cooling of the general economic environment. While growth is expected to be weak in residential and commercial building markets and in some industrial markets, continued robust demand is expected for data centers and power distribution. Overall, market development in fiscal 2024 is expected to continue to be influenced by rebalancing of supply chains, trade conflicts and effects from geopolitical tensions.
