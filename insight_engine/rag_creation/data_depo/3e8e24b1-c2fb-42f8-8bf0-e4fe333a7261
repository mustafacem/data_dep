Independent assurance Our sustainability reporting is subject to high quality stan-

dards. Therefore, as in previous years, we commissioned an independent audit firm to conduct a limited assurance of our Sustainability Report 2023. The results of the assurance conducted by Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- gesellschaft are presented in the chapter titled “Independent auditor’s limited assurance report.”

Editor’s note An effort has been made to use gender-neutral language

throughout. Nevertheless, if on occasion the masculine form is used for easier readability, it stands for people of all genders.
