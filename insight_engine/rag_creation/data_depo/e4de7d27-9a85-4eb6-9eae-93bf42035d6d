SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 12

Customer Impact At Siemens we rely on a mature Key Account Management

approach to systematically structure and drive our Key Cus- tomer relationships company-wide. While all our customers are served by the general Sales organization, Key Customers are also managed through our Key Account Management approach.

Over and above our basic sales approach, Siemens’ primary principles for successful Key Account Management are a special understanding of our customers’ technology and vertical markets along with the collaboration among all customer-facing parties – across functional, organizational, and regional boundaries (“go-to-market” approach).
