At the beginning of May 2023, the members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards met several times in smaller groups (so-called multilateral strategy sessions) to consider and discuss in detail topics of strategic importance to the Company.

At our meeting on May 16, 2023, the Managing Board reported on the Company’s current business and finan- cial position, including personnel-related matters and sustainability, as of the second quarter. As part of a stra- tegic focus, we concerned ourselves at this meeting – on the basis of the strategy discussions held in the previous weeks in smaller groups with the Managing Board – ex- tensively and in detail with the growth targets and the further implementation of Siemens’ strategy as a focused technology company. For Siemens Xcelerator, our open digital business platform, growth targets for the portfolio at the Siemens and business level were presented in de- tail and the status of the two pillars “ecosystem” and “marketplace” were discussed. We were also informed about the current business position of Siemens Healthi- neers and about progress in the integration of Varian. We approved amendments to the Bylaws for the Managing Board, for the Supervisory Board and for the Chairman’s Committee, the Audit Committee, the Innovation and Finance Committee, and the Compensation Committee
