Eligibility for Siemens sponsored benefits such as share plans, company pension scheme, the employee benefits programs, and parental/family leave regulations varies by country. Country-specific plans generally follow local regula- tions and market practices.

Work-life balance To provide our people with even more flexibility and individ-

ual solutions, we offer flexible working models. These models are structured according to local requirements and in ways that are compatible with the employeesâ€™ roles. For instance, Siemens offers mobile working, part-time hours, sabbaticals, time-outs, parental/family leave, and partial early retirement. Parental leave for first and second care enables our people to manage their unique work-life needs.
