The Supervisory Board meeting on September 22, 2023,

was held in Berlin, where we gained an insight into the future-oriented project Siemensstadt Square and, on a tour of the Röhrenwerk tube plant, familiarized ourselves with the advanced production and manufacturing methods at the long-standing location. At the meeting, the Managing Board reported on the state of the Company. The person- nel strategy of Siemens AG was again a focus of the meet- ing. Following up on its reporting on December 7, 2022, the Managing Board informed us about the strategic approach to systematic workforce training, which aimed to drive the organization’s transformation and empower its employees to continuously learn and grow. We dis- cussed the Managing Board’s considerations regarding the 2024 budget. A further focus of the meeting was Manag- ing Board compensation, whose appropriateness had been confirmed by an internal review. After preparation by and on a recommendation of the Compensation Commit- tee, we approved an adjustment of the compensation system for the Managing Board as of fiscal 2024. As part of the annual review of Managing Board compensation and after preparation by and on a recommendation of the Compensation Committee, we determined each Manag- ing Board member ’s individual total target compensation and maximum compensation and defined the perfor- mance criteria for variable compensation for fiscal 2024. In addition, we dealt with matters relating to corporate gov- ernance – in particular, the Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code. We approved amendments to the Bylaws for the Managing Board and changes to the diversity concept for the Managing Board.
