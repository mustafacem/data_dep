4,324 suppliers – who stand for 43% of our Scope 3 upstream (tier 1) footprint – have provided us with primary data by taking part in our Carbon Reduction@Suppliers program. 2,038 of them have shared their decarbonization plans with us by joining the supplier+s platform, which was launched in fiscal 2023. Based on the responses we received and calcu- lated, there was an average reduction of 9% in the previously calculated emissions for these suppliers, equivalent to a decrease of 464,000 metric tons of CO2e. This indicates that our suppliers have been more supportive in reducing our carbon footprint in the supply chain compared to the previous year’s reduction of 359,000 metric tons of CO2e. This effort helped reduce our Siemens Scope 3 upstream footprint against our baseline year 2020 by 0.9% and against the previous year 2022 by 3.3%.1
