B.3.2 Long-term variable compensation (Stock Awards)

B.3.2.1. BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING

Siemens grants long-term variable compensation in the form of Stock Awards. A Stock Award is the claim to one share – conditional on target achievement – after the expiration of a defined vesting period. The vesting period is, accordingly, the term of each Stock Awards tranche.

At the beginning of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board defines a target amount in euros based on 100% target achievement for each Managing Board member. This target amount is extrapolated to target achievement of 200% (“maximum allocation amount”). Stock Awards for this maximum allocation amount are then allocated to the Managing Board members. The number of Stock Awards is calculated by dividing the maximum allocation amount by the price of the Siemens share on the allocation date, less the estimated discounted dividends (“allocation price”).
