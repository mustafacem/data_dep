Recalculation To enable consistency, especially over time, Siemens Busi-

nesses and SFS recalculate the Customer Avoided Emissions in accordance with the guideline. Events that lead to relevant changes in the data on Customer Avoided Emissions typically include corporate mergers, acquisitions, and divestments, mistakes in previous calculations, changes in external stan- dards or in the Siemens calculation methodology, significant changes in the parameters and assumptions applied in the calculation, and any other events that lead to material changes in calculation estimates.
