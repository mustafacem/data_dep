With the support of our EHS experts and sustainability officers, the operational managers in our global units oversee the implementation of environmental guidelines and programs.

Siemens has also founded expert panels to ensure that environmental considerations are integral to our decision- making. The Global Board EHS is comprised of subject-matter experts who develop environmental protection measures and programs and provide advice to the Chief People and Sustainability Officer in consultation with the Siemens Sustainability Board.
