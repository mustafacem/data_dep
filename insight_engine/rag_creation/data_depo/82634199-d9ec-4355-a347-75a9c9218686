To drive additional transparency on our journey to 2030, we set an ambitious interim reduction target for our business operations at Siemens without SHS of 55% by 2025 com- pared to 2019.

For scope 3 emissions, Siemens (without Siemens Healthineers) has set a target to reduce CO2e emissions generated in our supply chain by 20% by 2030 compared to 2020. We also aim to achieve Net Zero emissions in our supply chain by 2050.
