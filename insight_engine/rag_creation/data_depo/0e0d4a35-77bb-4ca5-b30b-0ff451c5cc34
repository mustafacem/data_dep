We issued a guideline that defines the criteria for the CO2-neutral operation of new buildings and sets maximum permissible emissions in the supply chain and in construction activities. In fiscal 2023, we launched our new SRE3 Green Lease Guideline to improve the ESG performance of all new leases. Following the guideline, the renovation and expansion of our Texas facility is planned to reduce 90% of emissions. In California, a relocation led to using 58% less space and reducing CO2e emissions by 68 metric tons.
