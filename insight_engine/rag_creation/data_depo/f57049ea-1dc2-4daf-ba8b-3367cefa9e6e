All Siemens entities are part of our ICS and ERM. The scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different, depending, among others, on the entityâ€™s impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens and the specific risks associated with the entity. The management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within their area of responsibility, based on the group-wide mandatory methodology.

Overall responsibility for our ICS and ERM lies with the Managing Board. The Siemens Risk and Internal Control (RIC) organization bundles and integrates the internal control and ERM processes and supports the Managing Board in designing and maintaining adequate and effective processes for implementing, monitoring and reporting on internal control and ERM activities. It consists of the central RIC departments of Siemens AG and the RIC departments at our organizational units. The central RIC departments are responsible for monitoring and coordinating the entire processes in order to ensure an adequate and effective ICS and ERM within the Group.
