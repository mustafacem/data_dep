The program has three components. At the center of the Responsible Product Development program component is our Robust Eco Design approach. The program intends to introduce methods and rules for dematerialization along the entire value chain. The second component of the program, a Clean Supply Chain, aims to increase the percentage of sec- ondary materials we use and to reduce regulated substances by 2030. The third component, Efficient Own Operations, aims to reduce environmental impacts at our own sites.
