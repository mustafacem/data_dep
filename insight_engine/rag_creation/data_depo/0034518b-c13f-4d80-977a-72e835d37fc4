Topics associated with climate change appeared regularly on the agenda of EC SUS and SSB meetings in fiscal 2023 and included, for example, our Net Zero Operations Program implementation or product-related decarbonization efforts.

The Sustainability Executive Committee (EC SUS) acts as guidance body for Siemens sustainability business – the Siemens portfolio that enables positive sustainability impact by addressing and financing (i) decarbonization and energy efficiency, (ii) resource efficiency and circularity as well as (iii) people centricity and social impact – with a focus on portfolio market segments and go-to-market topics, and it meets on an ad hoc basis to discuss relevant subjects. Chaired by Siemens’ CEO, the EC SUS includes Siemens’ CSO, the CEOs of key businesses, Chief Strategy Officer, General Counsel, and Global Head of SUS.
