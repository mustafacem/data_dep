Revenues from construction-type contracts: Revenues are recognized over time under the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.

The percentage-of-completion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimates include total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical, political and regulatory risks, risks from supply chain constraints and other judgments. Under the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition, Siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is terminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis.
