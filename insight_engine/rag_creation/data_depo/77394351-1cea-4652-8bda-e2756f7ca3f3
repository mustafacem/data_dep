NOTE 26 Derivative financial instruments and valuation units

As a consequence of its global operating, investing and financing activities, Siemens AG is in particular exposed to risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, managed in line with a proven risk management system in consideration of defined risk limits. As the parent company of the Siemens Group, Siemens AG has the central role within the group-wide management of financial market risks. To manage the risks resulting from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, Siemens AG uses primarily foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps as well as combined interest and foreign currency swaps. Thereby the operating units of Siemens AG are not allowed to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The contract partners of the Company for derivative financial instruments are banks, brokers and affiliated companies. The credit rating for banks and brokers is constantly monitored.
