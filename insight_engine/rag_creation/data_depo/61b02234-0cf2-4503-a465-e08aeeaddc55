Goal 17 – Strengthen the means of implementa- tion and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development

As a global company and an advocate of free trade, we believe that partnerships are a key to sustainable develop- ment and to our company’s success. We also recognize the importance of digitalization, project financing, and public- private partnerships for sustainable development. In all of these areas, we are partnering with international organiza- tions, business organizations, think tanks, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and academia, including the UNGC, World Economic Forum (WEF), econsense, Transparency International, and numerous universities.
