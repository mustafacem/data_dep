Translation risk

Many Siemens units are located outside the Eurozone. Because the financial reporting currency of Siemens is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euro for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. To consider the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is that investments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro are reflected in the Companyâ€™s consolidated equity position.
