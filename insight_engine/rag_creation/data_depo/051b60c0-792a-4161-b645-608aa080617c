Warranty obligations included obligations of Siemens AG towards affiliated companies totaling â‚¬1.0 billion.

Siemens AG only enters into guarantees and other commitments after careful consideration of the risks concerned and in general only in relation to its own business activities or those of affiliated companies as well as to business activities of companies, if it holds an investment in them or their parent companies. Based on an ongoing risk evaluation of the arrangements entered into and taking into account all information available up to the date on which the Annual Financial Statements were issued for approval, Siemens AG concluded that the relevant primary debtors are able to fulfill the underlying obligations. For this reason, Siemens AG considered it not probable that it will be called upon in conjunction with any of the guarantees and commitments described above.
