Compliance risk management is an integral part of the company-wide Siemens Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program SIEMENS FINANCIAL REPORT FOR FISCAL 2023, COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT, 8.3.1 STRATEGIC RISKS, which provides a holistic view of all identified risks throughout the Group. Every entity and region assesses their business risks in rela- tion to compliance risks. Current developments are also systematically evaluated.

As a core part of our risk management process, we collabo- rate closely with relevant business units to identify and assess compliance risks within new digital business models. Continuous Compliance Risk Management implements a bottom-up evaluation of the local risk environment in each of Siemensâ€™ entities on a worldwide basis in all activity fields defined by Compliance. CEOs, business leaders, Compliance Officers, and experts from every entity meet during the fiscal year to identify and assess compliance risks.1 The risks iden- tified are then aggregated and presented during annual Compliance Risk and Performance Reviews to the Compli- ance Management Council. The risks are documented in the Compliance Risk Tracking tool.
