78% of the reported incidents were assigned to the “minor” category (minor injuries like scratches and abrasions). Finger injuries continued to account for the majority of incidents.

4 fatalities occurred in fiscal 2023. One contractor lost their life due to burns sustained in an arc-flash incident, and another contractor passed away after being struck by a piling rig’s leg. Among the other two contractor fatalities, one occurred during ventilation maintenance using a lifting platform, and the other during work on a construction site while using a mobile scaffold. Each incident and fatality is a source of grief for the people concerned as well as their families, friends, and colleagues. Each incident is a renewed call for us to keep improving and ensuring a safe and healthy work environment for our people and partners.
