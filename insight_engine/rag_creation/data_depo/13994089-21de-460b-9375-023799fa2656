During fiscal 2023, we made further progress in focusing our business portfolio by selling our Commercial Vehicles business. Furthermore, we began forming a new motors and large drives company under the name Innomotics by combining our existing business activities in the areas of low- to high-voltage motors, geared motors, medium-voltage converters and motor spindles. Also, we further reduced our stake in Siemens Energy AG to 25.1% and transferred shares to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. To boost future growth and drive innovation, we announced a â‚¬2 billion investment strategy mainly for new manufacturing capacity as well as innovation labs and education centers. We also expanded our open digital business platform, Siemens Xcelerator, by introducing Industrial Operations X, which includes a broad range of interoperable offerings for more adaptive production, and by adding new cloud-based applications for Building X, our suite for smart and sustainable buildings.
