The result compares with analysts' expectations of EUR1.69 billion in net profit and EUR18.58 billion in revenue, according to a company-provided consensus.

Siemens said the result reflected earnings growth across most of its industrial businesses, led by its smart infrastructure business, which reached its highest-ever quarterly profit.

Smart infrastructure posted a 26% profit increase to EUR885 million, driven by demand for data centers and power distribution. Included in that result was a EUR94 million gain from the partial reversal of a liability related to past portfolio activities, the company said.
