Both the increase in interest income from €387 million in the prior year to €1,014 million in the current fiscal year and the swing in interest expense from income of €51 million in the prior year to expenses of €1,586 million in the current fiscal year resulted primarily from the effects of higher interest rates in connection with intragroup financing.

Interest expenses included interest expenses from affiliated companies of €1,548 million (2022: €67 million interest income).
