Where SFS agreed to finance fossil power generation projects in fiscal 2023, its financial contributions corresponded to about 3 million metric tons of CO2e over the expected duration of the financing of these projects (Scope 3.15 investments).

Carbon offsets Our internal offsetting policy has established binding guide-

lines for procuring carbon offsets. This policy aims to ensure consistency and quality in offset programs. The carbon off- sets derived from projects for removing or avoiding CO2e emissions must meet minimum quality criteria, including external certification, selection based on the Oxford Offset- ting Principles, and internal quality controls. Despite our high standard for all offsetting, physically reducing emissions remains Siemensâ€™ top priority. We also do not deduct carbon offsets from our CO2e footprint in order to maintain transpar- ency regarding our emissions.
