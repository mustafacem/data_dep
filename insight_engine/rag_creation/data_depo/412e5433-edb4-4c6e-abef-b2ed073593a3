Ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating methodologies, with information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data service providers and Siemens’ credit default experiences. Internal ratings consider appropriate forward-looking information relevant to the specific financial instrument like expected changes in the debtor’s financial position, ownership, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industry- related and competitive developments. The ratings also consider a country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings. Ratings and credit limits for financial institutions as well as Siemens' public and private customers, which are determined by internal risk assessment specialists, are continuously updated and considered for investments in cash and cash equivalents and in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect financing will be offered to customers.
