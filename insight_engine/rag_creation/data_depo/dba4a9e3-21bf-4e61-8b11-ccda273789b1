Derivative financial instruments are used by Siemens AG almost exclusively for hedging purposes and – if the relevant conditions are met – are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. When a valuation unit is created, changes in values or cash flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared. A provision is recognized only for a negative surplus from the ineffective part of the market value changes. The unrealized gains and losses from the effective part offset each other completely and are not recognized in the Balance Sheet or the Income Statement.
