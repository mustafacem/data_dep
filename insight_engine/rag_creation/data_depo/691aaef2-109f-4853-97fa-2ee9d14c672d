Determination of total target achievement

At the end of the approximately four-year vesting period, the Supervisory Board determines the degree of target achievement. The target achievement range for TSR and for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is between 0% and 200%. If target achievement is less than 200%, a number of Siemens Stock Awards equivalent to the shortfall are forfeited without refund or replacement and a correspondingly smaller number of shares is transferred.

The value of the Siemens shares transferred after the expiration of the vesting period is also capped at 300% of the target amount. If this cap is exceeded, a corresponding number of Stock Awards is forfeited without refund or replacement.
