We advance technologies also through our open innovation concept. We work closely with scholars from leading universities, research institutions and academic start-ups, not only under bilateral cooperation agreements but also in publicly funded collective projects. Our focus here is on our strategic research partners and in particular the Siemens Research and Innovation Ecosystems, which we maintain at 16 locations worldwide.

Siemensâ€™ global venture capital unit, Next47, provides capital to help start-ups expand and scale. It serves as the creator of next-generation businesses for Siemens by building, buying and partnering with innovative companies at any stage. Next47 is focused on anticipating how emerging technologies will influence our end markets. This foreknowledge enables our Company and our customers to grow and thrive in the age of digitalization.
