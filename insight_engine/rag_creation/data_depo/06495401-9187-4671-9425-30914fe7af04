96%

of our sites have implemented a water strategy

Our water strategy provides foundational support to our compliance with the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria for sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources in the EU Taxonomy.

In fiscal 2023, our total water withdrawal was 14.26 million m³. The largest share of our water use is for cooling processes. These processes leave the water’s chemical quality largely unchanged, so that the water can be returned directly to the receiving water body or groundwater. In fiscal 2023, our water discharge was 13.56 million m3.
