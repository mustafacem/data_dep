Insurance contracts – In June 2020, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (IFRS 17), effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Siemens will adopt the standard commencing with fiscal 2024. IFRS 17 introduces and applies uniform accounting policies for insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS 4 Insurance contracts. The adoption of IFRS 17 is not expected to have a significant impact on Siemens’ Consolidated Financial Statements.
