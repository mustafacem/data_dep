As Siemens’ top management body, the Managing Board is committed to serving the interests of the Company and achieving sustainable growth in company value. The members of the Managing Board are jointly responsible for the entire management of the Company and decide on basic issues of business policy and Company strategy, including Siemens’ sustainability strategy as well as on the Company’s annual and multiyear plans, unless specific circumstances are taken into account for compa nies that are separately managed and publicly listed themselves (Siemens Healthineers). The Companywide DEGREE program, which was approved by the Managing Board in fiscal 2021, intensified the focus of all Siemens businesses on ambitious sustainability targets – targets for environmental and social sustainability and good governance – even further. The Managing Board ensures that the risks and opportunities for the Company connected with social and environmental factors and the environmental and social impact of the Company’s activities are systematically identified and assessed. The Company strategy gives due consideration to longterm targets as well as to environmental and social objectives. Company planning encompasses both the appropriate financial targets and the appropriate sustainabilityrelated objectives. More details on sustainability are available
