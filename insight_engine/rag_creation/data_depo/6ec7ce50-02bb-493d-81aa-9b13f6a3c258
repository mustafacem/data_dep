Integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into all aspects of our people experience journey During the regular review of our practices, we realized that

integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into all aspects of our people experience – from recruitment and onboarding to career development – is the key element in a more diverse and inclusive working environment.

We launched our global Gender Equity Program (GEP)1 with the aim of ensuring equity of opportunities across the entire organization – from equitable hiring into business functions and equitable promotions to management to representation of women in top management.1
