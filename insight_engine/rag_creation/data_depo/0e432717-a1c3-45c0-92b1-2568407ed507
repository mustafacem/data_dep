At the end of the fiscal year, target achievement for the individual key performance indicators and the achievement of the Managing Board membersâ€™ individual targets are determined and aggregated to form a weighted average. The percentage of weighted target achievement multiplied by the individual target amount yields the Bonus payout amount for the past fiscal year. The payable Bonus is capped at two times the target amount and is paid in cash, at the latest, together with the compensation paid at the end of February of the following fiscal year.
