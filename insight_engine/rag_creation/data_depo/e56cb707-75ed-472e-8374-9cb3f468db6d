2.3 Capital structure

Sustainable revenue and profit development is supported by a healthy capital structure. Accordingly, a key consideration within the Siemens Financial Framework is to maintain ready access to the capital markets through various debt products and preserve our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. Our primary measure for managing and controlling our capital structure is the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA (continuing operations). This financial measure indicates the approximate amount of time in years that would be needed to cover Industrial net debt through income from continuing operations, without taking into account interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We aim to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5.
