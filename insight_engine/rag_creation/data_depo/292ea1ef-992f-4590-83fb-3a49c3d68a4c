HUMAN RIGHTS CYBERSECURIT Y AND DATA PRIVACY

To ensure compliance throughout the company, the Siemens comprehensive compliance system is based on the three pillars of prevention, detection, and response.

Preventive measures include compliance risk management, preparing topic-specific guidelines and procedures, incorpo- rating compliance requirements into business processes, our Collective Action activities, and providing comprehensive training and advice to our people.

In addition, protected channels for reporting compliance violations like the “Tell Us” whistle-blower system, the Ombudsperson, and professional and fair investigations are indispensable for identifying and resolving matters of indi- vidual misconduct. Our reporting channels also allow our people to submit reports anonymously.
