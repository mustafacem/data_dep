Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at period-end. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value.

Provisions â€“ A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when (1) it is probable that the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and (2) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and (3) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.
