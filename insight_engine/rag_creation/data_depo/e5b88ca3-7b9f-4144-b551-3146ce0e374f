Inventories are measured at the lower of average acquisition or production costs and daily values. Production costs comprise, in addition to direct costs, an appropriate portion of production and material overheads and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. General administration expenses, expenses for social facilities, voluntary social costs and company pension scheme costs are not capitalized. Write- downs are recorded to cover inventory risks for reduced usability and technological obsolescence as well as in the context of loss-free valuation of unbilled contracts in construction-type and service businesses.
