→ Direct comparison with a reference technology: Refers to the difference between the Siemens offering and a comparable other single technology or predecessor with a similar purpose. This comparison may be applied, for example, to new product generations or the electrifi- cation of fossil fuel technologies.

→ Comparison with the installed base: Refers to the difference between the Siemens offering and an average market solution used for the same or a similar purpose (market standard). This comparison can be applied, for example, to renewable energy projects by drawing a comparison with the average global greenhouse gas emission factor for electricity generation.
