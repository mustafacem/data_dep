Responsibilities of the auditor

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the EU Taxonomy disclosure based on our assurance engagement.

We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Company’s EU Taxonomy disclosure is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the interpretation by management disclosed in the EU Taxonomy disclosure. In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the auditor.
