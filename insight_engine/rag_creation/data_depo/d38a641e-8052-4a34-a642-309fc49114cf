Orders

Orders are determined principally as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligations exist as well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding letters of intent. To determine orders, Siemens considers termination rights and customer’s creditworthiness.

As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, order backlog totaled €111 billion and €102 billion (continuing operations); thereof Digital Industries €11 billion and €14 billion, Smart Infrastructure €16 billion and €15 billion, Mobility €45 billion and €36 billion and Siemens Healthineers €34 billion and €34 billion. In fiscal 2024, Siemens expects to convert approximately €43 billion of the September 30, 2023 order backlog into revenue; thereof at Digital Industries approximately €8 billion, Smart Infrastructure approximately €10 billion, Mobility approximately €11 billion and Siemens Healthineers approximately €11 billion.
