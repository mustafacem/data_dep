Due to the increase in the Stock Awards target amounts, variable compensation is structured on a more long-term basis, while compensation as a whole is oriented even more toward sustainable Company development.

Regarding compensation, all components of the compensation of the position of President and CEO are differentiated. The target amount of Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas’s Stock Awards is differentiated due to his particular responsibilities as CFO. The target amount of Cedrik Neike’s Stock Awards is also differentiated due to the outstanding business results of Digital Industries, the strategic importance of this Business for the further development of Siemens AG and Cedrik Neike’s five- years of membership on the Managing Board.
