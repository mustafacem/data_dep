Data protection in our products and solutions

(privacy by design) Siemens wants to ensure that its products and solutions can be

used in compliance with all relevant data protection rules. At Siemens, privacy by design means that compliance with the law, transparency, informational self-determination, data minimization, and data security are already applied when products and services are developed. Therefore, privacy by design is integrated into our product development processes.
