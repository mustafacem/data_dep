We are exposed to currency translation effects, mainly involving the U.S. dollar, the British pound and currencies of emerging markets, particularly the Chinese yuan. Siemens is still a net exporter from the Eurozone to the rest of the world, so a weak euro is principally favorable for our business and a strong euro is principally unfavorable. While we expect volatility in global currency markets to continue in fiscal 2024, we have improved our natural hedge on a global basis through geographic distribution of our production facilities in the past. In addition to the natural hedging strategy, we also hedge currency risk in our export business using derivative financial instruments. We expect these steps to help us limit effects on income related to currency in fiscal 2024. In this outlook, we assume that currency translation effects in fiscal 2024 slightly reduce nominal volume growth rates for Siemens and profitability of our businesses.
