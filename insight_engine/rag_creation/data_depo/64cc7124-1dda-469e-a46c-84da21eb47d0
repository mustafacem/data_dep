We assessed the underlying valuation models for the determination of the net realizable value in terms of methodology and reperformed the calculations with the assistance of internal valuation specialists. We further obtained explanations from management regarding material value drivers of the planning and examined whether the budget planning reflects general and industry-specific market expectations. Forecast accuracy was assessed on a sample basis using budget-to-actual comparisons of historically forecast data with the actual results. The parameters used to estimate net realizable value such as the estimated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital rates were assessed by comparing them to publicly available market data. We also performed our own sensitivity analyses to assess the impairment risk in the case of a reasonably possible change in one of the significant assumptions.
