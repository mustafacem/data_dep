Offsetting of assets and of income and expenses: Siemens AG measures assets at fair value that are designated as being held exclusively to settle specified pension obligations and obligations for early retirement (“Altersteilzeit”) arrangements and which cannot be accessed by other creditors.

Pensions and similar commitments: Siemens AG measures its pension obligations using the settlement amount calculated with the actuarial projected unit credit method on the basis of biometric probabilities. The discount rate used corresponds to the average market interest rate for instruments with an assumed remaining maturity of 15 years as published by German Federal Reserve Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank).
