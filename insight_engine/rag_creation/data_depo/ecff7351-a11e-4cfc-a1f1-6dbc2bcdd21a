These initiatives have been incorporated into our internal guidelines and policies. They have also led to the creation of customized roles and responsibilities within our key functions, our businesses, and our regions. As part of our commitment to responsible business conduct, we have piloted the process of environmental, social, and human rights deep-dive due diligence that will be conducted annually for established key business partners and strategic partners. This process has been piloted in fiscal 2023 and will become mandatory beginning in fiscal 2024.
