In addition to our strategic sustainability activities, the CSO ensures that we operate in compliance with our environ- mental guidelines. Our EHS Principles serve as internal binding guidelines for this purpose. Siemens has also founded expert panels to ensure that environmental consid- erations are integral to our decision-making. The Global Board EHS is composed of subject-matter experts who develop environmental protection measures and programs and provide advice to the Chief People and Sustainability Officer in consultation with the Siemens Sustainability Board.
