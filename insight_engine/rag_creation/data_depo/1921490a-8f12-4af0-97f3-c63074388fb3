The Supervisory Board concurs with the results of the au- dit. Following the definitive findings of the Audit Com- mittee’s examination and our own examination, we have no objections. The Managing Board prepared the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and the Consoli- dated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group. We approved the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Siemens Group. In view of our approval, these financial statements are accepted as submitted. We endorsed the Managing Board’s proposal that the net income available for distribution be used to pay out a dividend of € 4.70 per share entitled to a dividend and that the amount of net income attributable to shares of stock not entitled to receive a dividend for fiscal 2023 be carried forward.
