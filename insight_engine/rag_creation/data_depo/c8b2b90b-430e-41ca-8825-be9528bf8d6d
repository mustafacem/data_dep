Social dialog and relationship management Enabling a safe dialog between Siemens and our employee

representatives is important for building trust with our peo- ple. The following employee representative bodies are established at Siemens:

→ The Siemens Group Works Council, Central Works Council, local Works Councils, and other employee representative bodies represent all employees at Siemens in Germany – also disabled people and young workers.

→ Our Siemens Europe Committee (SEC) comprises 37 rep- resentatives from 23 countries. The SEC represents all our people in the EU countries and the UK, Switzerland, and Norway. In addition to three regional meetings, the annual SEC meeting with all SEC members, representatives of the company, and our CPSO took place in fiscal 2023.
