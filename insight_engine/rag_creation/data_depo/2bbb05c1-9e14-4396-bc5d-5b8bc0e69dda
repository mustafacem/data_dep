SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 126

We include all Kyoto gases in our emissions calculations: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). To assess the relevance of GHG emissions other than CO2, they are converted into metric tons of CO2 equivalents (CO2e). This number is based on the global warming potential over 100 years of each of the

We follow the financial control approach to consolidate the reporting of emissions.
