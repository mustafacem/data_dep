Extracting and processing finite resources contribute to as much as 90% of global biodiversity loss and approximately 50% of global CO2e emissions1. Both of these consequences can impact the composition, resilience, productivity, and carrying capacity of natural and managed ecosystems as well as people’s livelihoods. In 2023, the global economy was only 7.2% circular, meaning that just 7.2% of all material inputs into the economy were secondary materials.2

As such, we aim to reduce the environmental impact of our products, systems, solutions, and services as early as the design phase and minimize the need for raw material extraction. Our Ecodesign approach considers relevant eco- logical factors during product planning and design, because this phase determines up to 80% of a product’s lifecycle environmental impact.3 We also address these challenges through various initiatives: for instance, our Tech for Sus- tainability Bootcamp 2023, Ecodesign learning programs, and our Sustainability Business portfolio.
