Annual Financial Statements

The treasury shares purchased under the share buybacks may be used for purposes of retirement, distribution to employees, members of the executive bodies of companies affiliated with Siemens and members of the Managing Board, as well as the servicing of convertible bonds with attached warrants.

Following the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the Management Board resolved to redeem 50,000,000 treasury shares.

In fiscal 2023, Siemens AG re-issued in total 4,227,344 treasury shares under the exclusion of subscription rights in connection with share- based payments and employee share programs in the Group, equaling a nominal amount of €13 million and 0.5% of capital stock. The Company received in total €236 million for 1,843,831 shares, re-issued against payment of a purchase price. Siemens AG received this amount for unrestricted use. All shares were sold as investment shares in connection with the share matching program to plan participants. In each case, the purchase price was determined on the basis of the closing rate in Xetra trading, determined on a monthly effective date. Therefore, in the reporting period, in total 1,297,391 shares related to the monthly investment plan at a weighted average share price of €138.69 per share, 227,427 shares related to the share matching plan at a weighted average share price of €145.02 per share, and 319,013 shares related to the base share program at a weighted average share price of €72.51 per share (after consideration of a 50% subsidy by the Company). The other shares re-issued during the reporting period can be primarily attributed to the servicing of stock awards granted in fiscal 2019 totaling 1,693,126 shares, to 573,467 matching shares under the share matching program for fiscal 2020, and to 116,920 jubilee shares.
