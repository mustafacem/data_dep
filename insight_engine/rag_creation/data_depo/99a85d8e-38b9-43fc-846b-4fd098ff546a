Currency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current period and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison period. For calculating the percentage change year-over-year, this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparison period. A portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition or a disposition and is calculated as the change year-over-year in revenue related to the transaction. For calculating the percentage change, this absolute change is divided by revenue for the comparison period. Any portfolio effect is excluded for the twelve months following the relevant transaction after which both current and past reporting periods fully reflect the portfolio change. For orders, we apply the same calculations for currency translation and portfolio effects as described above.
