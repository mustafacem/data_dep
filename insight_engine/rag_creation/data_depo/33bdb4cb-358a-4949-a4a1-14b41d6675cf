Management of climate risks along our value chain

Climate change mitigation

In addition to our Science-Based Target, we defined a target in the DEGREE sustainability framework for our upstream Scope 3 emissions: Siemens without Siemens Healthineers (SHS) has set a target to reduce CO2e emissions generated in our supply chain by 20% by 2030 compared to 2020. We also aim to achieve Net Zero emissions in our supply chain by 2050. Details on our upstream Scope 3 emissions in fiscal 2023 can be found in the chapter SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES.
