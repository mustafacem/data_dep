According to the collective bargaining agreements in Ger- many, the pay system at Siemens is determined by collective bargaining negotiations between the trade union “IG Metall” and employers’ associations. 79% of our employees in Ger- many are covered by collective bargaining agreements, an additional 19% of our employees in Germany are covered by collective agreements subject to codetermination by the Works Council, and our senior managers (2% of employees in Germany) are represented by the “Executive staff committee.”
