The change in cash and cash equivalents, other securities relates to the liquidity management conducted by Corporate Treasury, which was focused not solely on the business activities of Siemens AG. The liquidity management is based on the financing policy of the Siemens Group, which is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Intra- group financing activities drove both a decrease of €4.5 billion in receivables from affiliated companies, which resulted in lower inventories, receivables and other assets, and a decrease of €4.5 billion in liabilities to affiliated companies, which was the main reason for the decrease of trade payables, liabilities to affiliated companies and other liabilities.
