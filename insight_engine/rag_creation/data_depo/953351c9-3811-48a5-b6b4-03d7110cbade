WEBSITE ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

Evaluating sustainability aspects is integral to our due diligence guidance. This means considering environmental protection in decisions about corporate mergers and acquisitions.

Our environmental policies require our sites to avoid activities that have negative impacts on local biodiversity, conduct water risk analyses, and implement water protection mea- sures. These factors are particularly important in vulnerable areas. The policies also include mandatory regulations for handling and reducing CO2e emissions and waste, especially landfill waste.
