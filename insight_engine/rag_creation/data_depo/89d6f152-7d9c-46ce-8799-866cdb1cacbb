In all material respects, this management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the management report does not cover chapter 11 “EU Taxonomy disclosure” of the combined management report, the sections “8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM” and “8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)” in chapter 8.5 of the combined management report and the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.
