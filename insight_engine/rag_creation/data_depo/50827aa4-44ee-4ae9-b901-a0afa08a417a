The Chairman’s Committee met eight times. Three meetings were held in person, two in a virtual format via video conference and three in a so-called hybrid format. The Chairman’s Committee also made one decision using other customary means of communication. In my capac- ity as Chairman of the Chairman’s Committee, I discussed topics of major importance with other Committee mem- bers also between meetings. The Committee concerned itself, in particular, with personnel-related matters, long- term succession planning for the composition of the Managing Board, corporate governance issues and the acceptance by Managing Board members of positions at other companies and institutions.
