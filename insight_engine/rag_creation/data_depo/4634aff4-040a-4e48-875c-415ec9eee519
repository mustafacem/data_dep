8.1.2 Siemens Group

We are basing our outlook for fiscal 2024 on the above-mentioned expectations and assumptions regarding the overall economic situation and also on the specific market conditions we expect for our respective industrial businesses, as described in chapter 3 Segment information. Furthermore, we assume that geopolitical tensions do not further increase. We expect improvements in productivity and adjusting prices for our own products, solutions and services to more than offset effects from wage increases and higher prices for raw materials and components.
