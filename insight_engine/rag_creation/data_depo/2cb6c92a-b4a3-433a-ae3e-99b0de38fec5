Clean Supply Chain: Using secondary materials to decouple natural resource use Building on the RED phase dematerialization, the Clean

Supply Chain category in the Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program maps our path to decoupling natural resource use from our economic growth.

In fiscal 2023, we emphasized making a continuous material change from plastics made from fossil fuels to sustainable and secondary thermoplastics. For example, we introduced a sustainable polyamide 6 composite with a recycling con- tent of 25% to 75% that engineers can apply in their designs. This can lead to a reduction of the product carbon footprint of 10% to 35%, depending on the application. We also devel- oped an internal standard for sustainable plastics and using of biobased resins made from waste.
