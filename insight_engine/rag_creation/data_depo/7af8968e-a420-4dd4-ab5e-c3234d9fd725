Climate change adaptation

We analyze potential risks in our supply chain, including environmental risks. We centralize sustainability-related data about our suppliers on the SCM Sustainability Platform, which enables us to gather information from diverse internal and external sources. This includes data on carbon reduction initiatives, corporate responsibility self-assessments (CRSA), on-site audit results, and risks associated with conflict minerals. All employees in Siemens' purchasing departments can access this integrated tool.
