The FutureOfWork@SIEMENS initiative The Siemens #FutureOfWork initiative tackles structural

changes in the working environment by asking two essential questions:

→ HOW will we work in the future? (#NewWork) → WHAT will we work on in the future? (#NextWork)

#NewWork focuses on helping organizations and individuals become more flexible and adaptable. For instance, exploring new forms of agile organization, collaboration, leadership, and flexible working conditions.
