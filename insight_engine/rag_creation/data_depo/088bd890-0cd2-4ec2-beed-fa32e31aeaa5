The Siemens Integrity Initiative focuses on supporting proj- ects that have a clear impact on the business environment, can demonstrate objective and measurable results, and have the potential to be scaled up and replicated.

So far, we have allocated approximately US$120 million for 85 projects in more than 50 countries across all funding rounds. Detailed information on this subject is provided in the Siemens Integrity Initiativeâ€™s annual reports.
