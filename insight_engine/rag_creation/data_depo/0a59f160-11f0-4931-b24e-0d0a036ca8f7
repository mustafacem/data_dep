7.8 United Nations CEO Water Mandate

7.8

United Nations CEO Water Mandate

Progress report Siemens became a signatory to the United Nations CEO

Water Mandate in 2008. We are continuing to support the Mandate in two ways: by managing water efficiently at our own facilities and by providing solutions that help our customers handle water and wastewater more efficiently.

Our own activities We are continuing to implement the approach to water

resource management that we developed in 2012. This includes monitoring factors like water scarcity, water pollution, flooding, environmental fire risks, and consequences of climate change as well as performing site-specific risk analyses. Individual goals and measures are defined for locations with high water-related risks. This approach minimizes the site-specific adverse impacts of our water consumption by taking into account local risks like water scarcity, water pollution, and flooding in environmentally sensitive areas. You can find out more about conserving resources and water consumption at Siemensâ€™ locations in the ENVIRONMENT section of this report.
