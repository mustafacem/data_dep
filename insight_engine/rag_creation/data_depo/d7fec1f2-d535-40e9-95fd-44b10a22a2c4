Foreword

Our sustainability ambitions are supported by 320,000 colleagues who bring our purpose to life every day – in an increasingly inclusive environment in 190 countries around the world. Within Siemens AG, women now hold 31% of top management roles, having achieved our 2025 ambition for 30% two years ahead of time. Our people are at the heart of this company. In fiscal 2023 we invested €416 million in our active learning culture, ensuring sustainable employability in rapidly changing markets. We have also made progress in the number of hours our people spent learning across the three strategic focus areas of digitalization, sustainability, and leadership: On average, our people have accrued 23 digital learning hours per person per year. And they are on track to increase that to our ambition of 25 digital learning hours by 2025.
