Cash outflows from change in receivables from financing activities of SFS related primarily to SFSâ€™s debt business.

Cash inflows from other disposals of assets included mainly proceeds from disposals of assets eligible as central bank collateral, from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business by Portfolio Companies, and from the sale or disposal of debt or equity investments.

Cash outflows from the re-issuance of treasury shares and other transactions with owners were driven by the purchase of Siemens Healthineers AG treasury shares.
