Separate preparatory meetings of the shareholder repre sentatives and of the employee representatives are held regularly in order to prepare the Supervisory Board meet ings. The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Managing Board in attendance. Every Supervisory Board member must disclose conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board. Information regarding conflicts of interest that may have arisen and their handling is provided in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Special informational (onboarding) events are held in order to familiarize new Supervisory Board members with the Company ’s business model and the structures of the Siemens Group. The Supervisory Board members take part, on their own responsibility, in the educational and training measures necessary for the performance of their duties – measures relating, for example, to changes in the legal framework and new, groundbreaking tech nologies. The Company supports them in this regard. Internal informational events are offered when necessary
