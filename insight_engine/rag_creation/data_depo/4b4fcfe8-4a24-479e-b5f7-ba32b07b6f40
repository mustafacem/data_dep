Our total assets at the end of fiscal 2023 were influenced by negative currency translation effects of â‚¬7.6 billion (particularly affecting goodwill and other financial assets), primarily involving the U.S. dollar.

The increase in other current financial assets was driven mainly by higher loans receivable at SFS, which were mainly due to new business and reclassification of loans receivable from other financial assets due to a reassessment of the expected repayment dates. The latter was a major factor also for the decrease of other financial assets, along with decreased positive fair values of derivative financial instruments.
