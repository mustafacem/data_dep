1.3 Strategy

Scaling sustainability impact These megatrends and their impacts are reshaping the needs

of our customers and markets. To create a holistic picture of potential futures, we execute sustainability scenario analyses that enable us to map impacts and risks, identify opportunities, and find new ways to create value through pathways by 2030 and 2040. Strategic insights are derived from scientific frameworks like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) as well as market trends and expert knowledge. The sustainability scenarios illustrate different possible development pathways for the global economy and Siemens’ operating environment across the focus topics climate, circularity, biodiversity, and society that take into account both an organized 1.5°C and a disorganized 3°C pathway. These scenarios guide the devel- opment of our sustainability strategy.
