We have an overarching, integrated ICS and ERM methodology (RIC methodology) with a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their adequacy and effectiveness. For more information on ERM, see chapter 8.2 Risk management.

Our ICS and ERM and their contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal audit function. These are carried out either as part of the risk-based annual audit plan or as part of audits scheduled during the year upon request. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit function and annual audit plan. Topics from the annual audit plan of Siemens Healthineers that are also relevant for our Managing Board and Audit Committee must be mandated first by Siemens Healthineersâ€™ Managing Board and Audit Committee
