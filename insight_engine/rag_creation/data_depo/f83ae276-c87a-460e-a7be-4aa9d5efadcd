Revenues from maintenance and service contracts: Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e. under the percentage-of-completion method as described above. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.

Revenues from product sales: Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within 30 days.
