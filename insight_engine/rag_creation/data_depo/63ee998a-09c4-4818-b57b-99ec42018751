SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 21

Identifying and prioritizing the topics In 2023, Siemens conducted internal workshops to help

identify our material topics by assessing their impacts, risks, and opportunities from two different perspectives:

→ Insideout perspective: Siemens took a closer look at its positive and negative

impacts on the environment and society (inside-out) caused by the company’s business activities.

During the inside-out assessment, we identified actual and potential positive and negative impacts for 17 sustainability topics and evaluated them according to their likelihood and their severity. Based on evaluations of the individual impacts, our material topics were derived. These topics are the foun- dation for determining the content of the GRI report. Including the outside-in perspective (see below) does not alter the results.
