We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of 24% to 29%. This assumption does not take into consideration possible impacts from potential major tax reforms.

Our forecast for net income takes into account a number of additional factors. We assume solid project execution continues in fiscal 2024. We plan to keep the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, which was 8% in fiscal 2023 at approximately the level in fiscal 2024. We expect the ratio of selling and general administrative expenses to revenue, which was 18% in fiscal 2023 to remain approximately on this level in fiscal 2024. Severance charges, which were â‚¬0.4 billion in fiscal 2023, are expected at a lower level in fiscal 2024.
