OUR SUSTAINABLIT Y INDICATORS

Our people shape Siemens’ learning activities In our regular Siemens Global Engagement Survey (SGES)1 in fiscal 2023, we asked our people about the growth mindset culture and their satisfaction with our learning opportunities.

The feedback of the SGES underlines that digital learning offers our people access to many more learning opportuni- ties and greater flexibility.

The survey results also shed light on the fact that our estab- lished Siemens MyGrowth program was successfully pro- moted worldwide and was well-received by our people. This was confirmed when we were recognized with several awards in fiscal 2023, such as two “Red Dot Design Awards” in the categories “Corporate Design” and “Educational Illus- tration” for MyGrowth.
