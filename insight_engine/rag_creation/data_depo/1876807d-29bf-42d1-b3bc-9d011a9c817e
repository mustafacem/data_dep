Water consumption is a water substream with a major envi- ronmental impact, because the water is no longer available for the ecosystem’s use. Siemens’ water consumption is mostly linked to evaporation and is comparably small, with just 0.51 million m3 of total water consumption. Of this amount, 0.07 million m3 are accounted for by water con- sumption in water stress areas.
