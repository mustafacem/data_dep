In Germany, the calculation of current taxes is based on a combined tax rate of 31%, consisting of a corporate tax rate of 15%, a solidarity surcharge thereon of 5.5% and an average trade tax rate of 15%. For foreign subsidiaries, current taxes are calculated based on the local tax law and applicable tax rates in the individual foreign countries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities in Germany and abroad are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled.
