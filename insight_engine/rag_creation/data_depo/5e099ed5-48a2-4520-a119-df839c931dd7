RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT The Company’s management is responsible for the prepara-

tion of the report in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (here- after the “GRI criteria”) and for the selection of the informa- tion to be assessed.

These responsibilities of the Company’s management include the selection and application of appropriate sustainability reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual sustainability disclosures that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, management is respon- sible for such internal control as management considers necessary to enable the preparation of a report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipu- lation of the report) or error.
