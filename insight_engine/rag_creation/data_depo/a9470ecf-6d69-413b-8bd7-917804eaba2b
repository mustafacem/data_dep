Science-Based Target

By joining the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), Siemens has pledged to reduce emissions from its own operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 50% and its value chain (Scope 3) by 15% by 2030 compared to 2019. Our commit- ment to the SBTi is aimed at aligning our business activities with the 1.5°C decarbonization pathway under the terms of recognized climate models to ensure that our greenhouse gas emissions will be consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement’s 1.5°C target.
