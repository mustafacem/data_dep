ROCE for fiscal 2023 rose to 18.6%, up from 10.0% in fiscal 2022. This increase was due to sharply higher income before interest after tax year-over-year. We thus exceeded the forecast for ROCE provided in our Combined Management Report 2022, which was to come close to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%.

We evaluate our capital structure using the ratio of Industrial net debt to EBITDA. Due to a combination of a decrease in Industrial net debt and higher EBITDA year-over-year, this ratio declined to 0.6. We thus achieved the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report 2022, which was to achieve a ratio of up to 1.5.
