The expected useful life is based on the expected use of the acquired businesses and is determined in particular by economic factors such as future growth and profit expectations, synergy effects and employee base.

Property, plant and equipment: The components of production costs are described in the context of the explanations for inventories. In general, property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. In certain cases, the declining balance method is applied, whereby a switch is made from the declining balance to the straight-line method as soon as the latter results in higher depreciation expense. Items are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. Low-value non-current assets that are subject to wear and tear, movable, and capable of being used independently, are expensed immediately or capitalized and fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.
