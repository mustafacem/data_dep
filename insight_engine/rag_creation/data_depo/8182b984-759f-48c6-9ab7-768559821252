The Share Ownership Guidelines are a further key component of the compensation system. They obligate Managing Board members to permanently hold Siemens shares worth a defined multiple of their base salary and to purchase additional shares in the event that the value of their shares falls below the defined amount.

The Managing Board compensation system is also supplemented by commitments granted in connection with the commencement and termination of appointments to the Managing Board as well as any change in the regular place of work.
