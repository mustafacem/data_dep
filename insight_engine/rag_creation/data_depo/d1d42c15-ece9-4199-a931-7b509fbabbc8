The active participation of our people enables our company-wide, country-specific, and business-specific initia- tives and programs to thrive. For instance, psychosocial risks are assessed once a year via the work well-being factors embedded in the Siemens Global Engagement Survey (SGES)1. The relevant teams then discuss and document the risks, opportunities, and measures, and outcomes in a struc- tured follow-up process.
