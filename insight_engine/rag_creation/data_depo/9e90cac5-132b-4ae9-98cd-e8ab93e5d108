Under the Special Vulnerability Handling program, CERT also takes proactive steps to support a consistently high level of protection by addressing potential vulnerabilities before any damage occurs.

The ProductCERT team addresses security issues that affect Siemens products and solutions. It is the central point of contact for reports of security gaps in Siemens products. As a key partner of the Siemens business units, the ProductCERT team supports the entire process – from identification to resolution of vulnerabilities – and provides crucial informa- tion to customers. Updated Siemens Security Advisories are published on a monthly basis to ensure our level of transpar- ency. With the CSAF format, we are among the leading industrial manufacturers for the automated distribution of vulnerability information.
