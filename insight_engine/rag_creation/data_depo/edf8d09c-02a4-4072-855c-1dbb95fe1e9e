Report of the Supervisory Board

The Nominating Committee met three times. Two meet-

ings were held in a virtual format via video conference and one in a so-called hybrid format. The Nominating Committee gave in-depth consideration to succession planning for the composition of the Supervisory Board. One focus of the Nominating Committee’s activities in fiscal 2023 was the preparation of the Supervisory Board’s nominations of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board for election by the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The Nominating Committee was supported in this connection by an external consulting firm. In selecting the potential candidates and in prepar- ing a recommendation for the Supervisory Board’s deci- sion, the Nominating Committee gave particular consid- eration to the objectives that the Supervisory Board had previously approved for its composition – including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Supervisory Board – and to the Supervi- sory Board’s qualification matrix. With a view to the reg- ular elections of three shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board scheduled for 2025, the Nominating Committee also defined the topics for its work over the next few years and concerned itself with the regulatory framework, with the objectives that the Supervisory Board had approved for its composition, including the profile of required skills and expertise and the diversity concept for the Supervisory Board, and with the qualifi- cation matrix.
