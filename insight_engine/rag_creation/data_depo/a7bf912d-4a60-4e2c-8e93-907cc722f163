Sustaining communities is key for social cohesion Siemens believes that identification with oneâ€™s local cultural

heritage is important for social cohesion. With this objective in mind, we support cultural and social activities. The Siemens Arts Program contributes to this objective with a diverse range of projects: for example, support for the first Namibian opera designed to promote intercultural under- standing. In addition, we help local communities create safe and stable environments. For instance, in fiscal 2023, we provided accommodations at our company premises in Warsaw to Ukrainian refugees.
