We make a significant impact on SDG 3 with our business portfolio, especially through SHS and the production tech- nologies we provide to pharmaceutical companies. In addition to the impact of our portfolio, we also care about the health and safety of our people and contract workers. Separately from SHS, Siemens sets ambitious goals for access to Employee Assistance Programs and for reducing employee accident rates (Lost time injury frequency rate â€“ LTIFR). We also participate in health-related community engagement activities like cancer awareness campaigns and mobile clinics.
