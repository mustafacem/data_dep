In addition, while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations, it cannot be excluded that violations of applicable governmental regulations may be caused either by us or by third parties that we contract with, including suppliers or service providers whose activities may be attributed to us. Any such violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties, fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our business operations. In particular, we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities we design or operate. With regard to certain environmental risks, we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. We may incur environmental losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance, and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition and results of operations.
