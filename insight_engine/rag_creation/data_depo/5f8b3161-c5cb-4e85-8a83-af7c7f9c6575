To evaluate our activities, we measure the achievement of the goals on the basis of the individual underlying targets and against a framework based on the I-O-O-I (input, output, outcome, impact) assessment method. A database and approval tool support the operating units in their efforts and helps to create transparency on a global level. This approach is accompanied by participation in numerous local and national working groups and commissions with the aim of improving the positive impact on society.
