8.3.5 Assessment of the overall risk situation

The most significant challenges have been mentioned first in each of the four risk categories: strategic, operational, financial and compliance.

While our assessments of individual risks have changed during fiscal 2023 due to developments in the external environment, changes in our business portfolio, effects of our own mitigation measures and the revision of our risk assessment, the overall risk situation for Siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year. We currently see the strategic risk economic, political and geopolitical conditions as the most significant challenge for us followed by the operational risk cyber/information security.
