The RED implementation rate for each product family is then determined by averaging the fulfillment levels of the individual RED criteria. We calculate the revenue share of our RED-con- formant portfolio by multiplying the RED implementation rate with the revenues of the given product families. Lastly,

the implementation rate KPI for RED is calculated as the ratio of the total RED-conformant revenue share to the total reve- nues of the relevant product families.

The RED approach allows us to use good practice results to identify practical Ecodesign measures in a product family that can then be used in other product families. Scheduled community meetings of product-related environmental protection practitioners facilitate this good practice knowledge-sharing across our business units. We also host Ecodesign case studies on an internal wiki to facilitate knowledge-sharing between our business units.
