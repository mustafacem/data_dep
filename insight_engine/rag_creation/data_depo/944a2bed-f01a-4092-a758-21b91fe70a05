SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 40

The Chief Compliance Officer, also appointed to serve as the Siemens Human Rights Officer by the Managing Board of Siemens AG, reports to the Supervisory Board and Managing Board on a regular and ad hoc basis on issues concerning human rights: for example, the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), for which Legal Compliance is the overarching coordination body.

The SSB has assigned overall responsibility for human rights to the Siemens Sustainability and Compliance departments. Their primary task is to proactively and systematically ensure that respect for human rights is deeply embedded in our company-wide processes and decision-making. To achieve this, both departments regularly assess opportunities for improvement in accordance with international standards. The Supply Chain, People and Organization, Environment, Health and Safety, Corporate Security, and Siemens Real Estate departments are responsible for embedding and maintaining human rights-related due diligence require- ments within their processes. This responsibility also includes the conceptualization and delivery of training and continuous learning formats.
