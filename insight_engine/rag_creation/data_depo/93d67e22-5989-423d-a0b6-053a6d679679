Work in the Supervisory Board committees In fiscal 2023, the Supervisory Board had six standing

committees. These committees prepare decisions and topics to be dealt with at the Supervisory Board’s plenary meetings. Some of the Supervisory Board’s decision-mak- ing powers have been delegated to these committees within the permissible legal framework. The committee chairpersons report to the Supervisory Board on their committees’ work at the subsequent Board meeting. A list of the members and a detailed explanation of the tasks of the individual Supervisory Board committees are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement.
