Our internal Compliance Policy requires every Siemens employee to collect and process personal data confidentially, only for legitimate and predetermined purposes, and in a transparent manner. This requirement is also reflected in our BCGs, which contain a section on data privacy requiring every employee to comply with the data protection require- ments of the laws and regulations within the legal systems where they are operating, as well as with Siemensâ€™ policies. In addition, the Siemens Compliance Handbook contains requirements for processing personal data, for documentation, and for reporting incidents.
