As of September 30, 2023, Siemens has the following reportable segments: Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure, Mobility and Siemens Healthineers, which together form our “Industrial Business” and Siemens Financial Services (SFS), which supports the activities of our industrial businesses and also conducts its own business with external customers. Furthermore, we report results for Portfolio Companies, which comprises businesses that are managed separately to improve their performance.

Our reportable segments and Portfolio Companies may do business with each other, leading to corresponding orders and revenue. Such orders and revenue are eliminated on Group level.
