Combined Management Report

Cash outflows for dividends attributable to non-controlling interests mainly included dividends paid to the shareholders of Siemens Healthineers AG.

With our ability to generate positive operating cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations of €12.2 billion in fiscal 2023, our total liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents plus current interest-bearing debt securities) of €11.1 billion, our unused lines of credit, and our credit ratings at year-end, we believe that we have sufficient flexibility to fund our capital requirements. Also in our opinion, our operating net working capital is sufficient for our present requirements.
