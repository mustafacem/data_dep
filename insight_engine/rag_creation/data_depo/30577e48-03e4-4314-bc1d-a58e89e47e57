We believe that focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion reduces the risk of making biased talent decisions. We have implemented recruitment and promotion strategies that promote equity of opportunities through our Gender Equity Program (GEP)1. We also offer various training opportunities on our new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Learning Channel, we empower managers and teams through our Belonging Playbook, and we foster an open dialog and insights on diversity, equity, and inclusion for all our people on our Belonging Days. This helps us to foster a diverse work environment.1 PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND LIFELONG LEARNING
