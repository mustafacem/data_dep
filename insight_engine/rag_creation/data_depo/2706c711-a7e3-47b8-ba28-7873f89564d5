Current and future investigations regarding allegations of corruption, of antitrust violations and of other violations of law: Proceedings against us or our business partners regarding allegations of corruption, of antitrust violations and of other violations of law may lead to fines as well as penalties, sanctions, injunctions against future conduct, profit disgorgements, disqualifications from directly and indirectly engaging in certain types of business, the loss of business licenses or permits, other restrictions and legal consequences as well as negative public media coverage. Accordingly, we may, among other things, be required to comply with potential obligations and liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings, including potential tax penalties. Moreover, any findings related to public corruption that are not covered by the 2008 and 2009 corruption charge settlements, which we concluded with U.S. and German authorities, may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations. Monitors could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices and our compliance program.
