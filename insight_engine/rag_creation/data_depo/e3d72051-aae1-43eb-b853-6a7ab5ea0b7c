Taken together, Digital Industries’ offerings enable customers to optimize entire value chains from product design and development through production and post-sale services. With its advanced software solutions in particular, Digital Industries supports customers in their evolution towards the “Digital Enterprise,” resulting in increased flexibility and efficiency of production processes and reduced time to market for new products. The most important customer markets include the automotive industry, the machine-building industry, the pharmaceutical and chemicals industry, the food and beverage industry and the electronics and semiconductor industry. Digital Industries serves its customers through a common regional sales organization spanning all its businesses, using various sales channels depending on the type of customer and industry and also enhancing customer choice across all channels. Changes in customer demand, especially for standard products, are driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, and can lead to significant short-term fluctuation in Digital Industries’ profitability. Volume from large contracts in the software business, particularly for EDA, may also result in strong fluctuations in quarterly volume and profitability. In fiscal 2023, Digital Industries continued to transition parts of its software business, particularly PLM, from largely upfront revenue recognition towards Software as a Service (SaaS), which yields more predictable recurring revenue and offers growth opportunities by opening access to new customers, especially small and medium-sized companies seeking to reduce costs associated with owning complex IT infrastructure. The transition held back revenue growth rates and profit margin development in the software business in fiscal 2023 and Digital Industries expects continued impacts until completion of the transition. Competition with Digital Industries’ business activities comes primarily from multinational corporations that offer a relatively broad portfolio and from smaller companies active only in certain geographic or product markets.
