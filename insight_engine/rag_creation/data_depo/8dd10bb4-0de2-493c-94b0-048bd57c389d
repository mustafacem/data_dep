Human rights in the supply chain One of our guiding principles is to maintain sustainable

supply chains. Siemens’ suppliers commit to upholding the Supplier Code of Conduct, which affirms the fundamental human rights of our suppliers’ employees. In fiscal 2023, we modified the Supplier Code of Conduct to include additional requirements from new regulations and prepared its rollout readiness for fiscal 2024.

The Code encompasses but is not limited to the following human rights topics:

→ Fair work conditions (pay, work hours, vacations) → Right to freedom of association → Responsibility for health and safety standards → Prohibition of discrimination → Prohibition of forced labor and child labor → Provision of anonymous grievance mechanisms
