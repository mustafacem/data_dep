In a challenging environment, order intake at Smart Infrastructure was a strong €5.8 billion and at the same high level as in the prior-year quarter. Orders again included a number of major contract wins. Revenue rose 9 percent on a comparable basis to €4.8 billion. All regions contributed to revenue growth since increasing demand for data centers and in the power distribution area, for example, helped offset macroeconomic headwinds particularly at the short-cycle businesses. Profit climbed 26 percent to €885 million. The profit margin was 18.3 percent (Q1 2023: 15.3 percent). Both profit and profitability were at the highest level ever achieved at Smart Infrastructure, benefiting from a positive €94 million effect from the partial reversal of a liability related to past portfolio activities.
