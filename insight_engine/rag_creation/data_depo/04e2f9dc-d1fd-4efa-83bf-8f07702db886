Data protection at our suppliers and partners Data protection requirements are consistently observed and

implemented within the Group and by our external suppliers and partners. Suppliers and partners undergo a preliminary data protection audit and are required by contract to adhere to data protection standards.

Documentation Siemens documents the purpose, risk, and security standards

applied to all the Groupâ€™s processing activities in a central database: the Register of Processing Activities. This register allows us to evaluate whether data protection law permits a given processing activity and to document compliance with the applicable laws.
