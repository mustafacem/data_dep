8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)

Our ICS and ERM also comprise a CMS aligned to the Company's risk situation which is based on the three pillars â€“ prevent, detect and react. It includes the legal risk areas of corruption, antitrust law, data protection, money laundering, export controls as well as human rights and is based on an extensive internal set of rules: The Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines (BCG) define the basic principles and standards of behavior that must be observed by all employees in the company units and in relation to customers, external partners and the public. In addition, there are extensive internal compliance regulations, including associated controls, which oblige all Siemens employees to ensure the implementation of the CMS. They contain topic-specific implementation regulations for the individual risk areas with regard to compliance processes and tools as well as additional guidelines and information. The compliance operating model contains binding specifications for the employees of the compliance organization and describes responsibilities and how the CMS works.
