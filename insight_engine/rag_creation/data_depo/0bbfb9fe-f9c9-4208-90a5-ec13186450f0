Current or future litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings: Siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes and proceedings in various jurisdictions. These legal disputes and proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates. Some of these legal disputes and proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens; or decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations, which may have material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Siemens maintains liability insurance for certain legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. However, the insurance policy does not protect Siemens against, in particular, reputational damage. Moreover, Siemens may incur losses relating to legal disputes and proceedings beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal disputes and proceedings. Finally, there can be no assurance that Siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future.
