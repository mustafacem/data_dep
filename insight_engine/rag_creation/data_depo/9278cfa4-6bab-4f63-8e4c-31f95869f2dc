The U.S. economy was a positive surprise. Although monetary policy was substantially tightened and the main policy interest rate was increased to 5.5%, consumption and investment were strong and GDP is expected to expand by 2.5% in calendar 2023. In particular the labor market was robust and unemployment remained at historic lows. Despite the strong economy, inflation and core inflation rates declined substantially. By end of calendar 2023, consumer price inflation is expected to be approximately 3%, after it reached nearly 6.5% at the end of calendar 2022. Receding global commodity and energy prices and the dissolvement of supply chain bottlenecks both helped ease inflation while tighter monetary policy had the desired effect of anchoring inflation expectations. This helped the U.S. avoid a price- wage-price spiral which could have led to structurally higher inflation rates.
