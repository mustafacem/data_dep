Internal programs and initiatives: We are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in cost-reduction initiatives, including ongoing capacity adjustment measures and structural initiatives. Consolidation of business activities and manufacturing facilities, outsourcings, joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these cost-reduction efforts. These measures may not be implemented as planned, may turn out to be less effective than anticipated, may become effective later than estimated or may not become effective at all. Any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual savings achieved and by our ability to sustain them. In case of restructuring and outsourcing activities, there could be delays in product deliveries or we might even experience delivery failures. Furthermore, delays in critical R&D projects could lead to negative impacts in running projects. We constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and milestone tracking approaches.
