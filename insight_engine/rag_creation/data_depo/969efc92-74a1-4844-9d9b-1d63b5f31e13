The survey pursues a holistic approach to customer relations because it follows up by implementing processes and systems designed to help foster long-term customer loyalty.4

Regardless of the score, we initiate a follow-up process after the survey, both internally and externally. When a score is low and considered critical, we take immediate action to identify key issues and determine what measures are needed to improve the relationship.

Our customersâ€™ satisfaction is our top priority

Despite the tense global situation (for example, with supply bottlenecks for materials and goods), our customers have recognized us for our customer support, reliable products, and a wide range of offerings. By consistently addressing their concerns, we have achieved a higher Net Promoter Score than the previous year.
