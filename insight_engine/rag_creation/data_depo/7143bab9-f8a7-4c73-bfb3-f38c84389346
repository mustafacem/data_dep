Our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information, and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information

• is materially inconsistent with the annual financial statements, with the management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

• otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
