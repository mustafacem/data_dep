SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 76

For each environmental objective, a catalog of relevant economic activities has been defined. When a business activity meets the definition of an economic activity, it is referred to as Taxonomy-eligible. EU Taxonomy alignment then requires the fulfillment of both the criteria for Substan- tial Contribution (SC) and the criteria for Do No Significant Harm (DNSH), together called Technical Screening Criteria (TSC). Moreover, the company involved must observe Mini- mum Safeguards (MS), e.g., compliance with human rights principles.
