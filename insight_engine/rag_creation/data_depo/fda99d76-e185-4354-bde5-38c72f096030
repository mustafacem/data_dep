4.1 Climate action

Upstream emissions Our upstream emissions total roughly 11 million metric tons of CO2e and are therefore considerably higher than the emissions from our own business operations. This is because

our supply chain operations are typically more energy- intensive than our own operations â€“ primarily because our supply chain processes raw materials.

A detailed description of our efforts to reduce CO2e emis- sions in our supply chain is available in SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES.
