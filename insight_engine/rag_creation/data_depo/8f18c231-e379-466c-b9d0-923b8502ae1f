Audits by tax authorities and changes in tax regulations: We operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax regulations. Changes in tax laws in any of these jurisdictions could result in higher tax expenses and increased tax payments. Furthermore, legislative changes could impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights. As a globally operating organization, we conduct business in countries subject to complex tax rules, which may be interpreted in different ways. Future interpretations or developments of tax regimes may affect our business situation, financial condition and results of operations. We are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify and assess relevant risks.
