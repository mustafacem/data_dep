The Company may not repurchase Siemens shares unless so authorized by a resolution duly adopted by the shareholders at a general meeting or in other very limited circumstances set forth in the German Stock Corporation Act. On February 5, 2020, the Shareholders’ Meeting authorized the Company to acquire until February 4, 2025 up to 10% of its capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution or – if the value is lower – as of the date on which the authorization is exercised. The aggregate of shares of stock of Siemens AG repurchased under this authorization and any other Siemens shares previously acquired and still held in treasury by the Company or attributable to the Company pursuant to Sections 71d and 71e of the German Stock Corporation Act may at no time exceed 10% of the then existing capital stock. Any repurchase of Siemens shares shall be accomplished at the discretion of the Managing Board either (1) by acquisition over the stock exchange, (2) through a public share repurchase offer or (3) through a public offer to swap Siemens shares for shares in a listed company within the meaning of Section 3 para. 2 German Stock Corporation Act. The Managing Board is additionally authorized to complete the repurchase of Siemens shares in accordance with the authorization described above by using certain derivatives (put and call options, forward purchases and any combination of these derivatives). In exercising this authorization, all stock repurchases based on the derivatives are limited to a maximum volume of 5% of Siemens' capital stock existing at the date of adopting the resolution at the Shareholders’ Meeting. A derivative’s term of maturity may not, in any case, exceed 18 months and must be chosen in such a way that the repurchase of Siemens shares upon exercise of the derivative will take place no later than February 4, 2025.
