Environment, social and governance â€“ The Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is based on three equally weighted, structured and verifiable ESG key performance indicators. At the beginning of each tranche, the Supervisory Board defines the target values for each of the ESG key performance indicators. Target measurement is based on defined interim targets for each fiscal year. Target achievement for the Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index is finally determined at the end of the approximately four-year vesting period on the basis of the weighted average of the target achievement values calculated for each of the key performance indicators.
