→ Phase 3 – Dematerialization

The preceding assessments are conducted to identify environmental design alternatives, the results are inter- preted, and where feasible they are incorporated into environmentally optimized design specifications. Typical Ecodesign strategies applied in this phase include increas- ing the use of secondary materials (recyclates), product repairability, upgradeability, or suitability for refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling, and the evaluation of new business models that enable take-backs after a product’s use.
