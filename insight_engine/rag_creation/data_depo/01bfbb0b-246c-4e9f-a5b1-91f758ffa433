In 2023, we significantly strengthened our sustainability organization throughout the company by introducing the Sustainability Executive Committee (EC SUS) and Heads of Sustainability in key businesses and business units, and we increased the responsibility of the Global Head of Sustain- ability (Global Head of SUS) and the Siemens Sustainability department.

The Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) oversees Siemensâ€™ sustainability topics. The CSO is a member of the Siemens Managing Board, chairs the Siemens Sustainability Board (SSB), and is a member of the Sustainability Executive Com- mittee (EC SUS). The CSO is also responsible for the Siemens Sustainability department.
