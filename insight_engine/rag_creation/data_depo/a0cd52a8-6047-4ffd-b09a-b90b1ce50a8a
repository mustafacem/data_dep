Our own Corporate Volunteering Standard describes a com- mon global corporate citizenship concept and framework which is supported by an internal volunteering platform being launched in fiscal 2023.

Targets As an important element of our sustainability strategy, cor-

porate citizenship is embedded in the DEGREE sustainability framework.1 By strengthening our identification of different target groups for our corporate citizenship activities and offering a range of training measures covering all phases of life, we contribute to two of the framework’s fields of action: Equity and Employability.

In every society where we operate, our ambition is to improve general living and healthcare conditions, enhance educa- tional and training opportunities for the labor market, and strengthen social cohesion and cultural identification. At the same time, we aim to strengthen Siemens’ reputation and local footprint, increase understanding of our technologies, and position our company as an attractive employer, while also laying the foundation for future innovation.
