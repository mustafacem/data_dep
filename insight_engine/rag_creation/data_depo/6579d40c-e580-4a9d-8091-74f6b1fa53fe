The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of our risk management system. In this context, Siemens has implemented a binding credit policy.

Siemens maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which numerous operating units from the Siemens Group regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized internal rating and credit limit recommendation process. Due to the identification, quantification and active management of credit risks, this increases credit risk transparency.
