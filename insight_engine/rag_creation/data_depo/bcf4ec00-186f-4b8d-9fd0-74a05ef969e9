Valuation unit used to hedge the interest rate risk

The interest rate hedging contracts used by Siemens AG serve to reduce interest rate risks within the framework of an integrated asset- liability management approach and to optimize the interest results.

Siemens AG has entered into interest rate derivatives with external counterparties to hedge interest rate swaps with its affiliated companies against interest rate risk. As of September 30, 2023, the interest rate swaps with affiliated companies with a maximum maturity term until the year 2028 included in this macro-valuation unit had a notional amount of €2,121 million and fair values of €122 million. At balance sheet date, these underlying transactions were matched by external interest rate derivatives with negative fair values of €59 million, net, and a maximum maturity term until the year 2030.
