Fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt obligations

Under interest rate swap agreements outstanding in fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company agreed to pay a variable rate of interest multiplied by a notional principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest multiplied by the same notional principal amount. These interest rate swap agreements offset future changes in interest rates designated as hedged risk on the fair value of the underlying fixed-rate debt obligations. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the carrying amounts of €13,164 million and €10,718 million, respectively, of fixed-rate debt obligations are designated in fair value hedges, including €(876) million and €(973) million cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. Unamortized fair value hedge adjustments of €112 million and €169 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, relate to no longer applied hedge accounting. The amounts are amortized over the remaining term of the underlying debt, maturing until 2042. Carrying amount adjustments to debt of €(95) million and €1,273 million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022 are included in Other financial income (expenses), net; the related swap agreements resulted in gains (losses) of €74 million and €(1,236) million, respectively, in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Net cash receipts and payments relating to such interest rate swap agreements are recorded as interest expenses.
