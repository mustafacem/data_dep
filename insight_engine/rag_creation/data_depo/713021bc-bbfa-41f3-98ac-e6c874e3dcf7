Foreword

Scaling sustainability impact In a tumultuous year of record-shattering heatwaves, wild-

fires and floods, and despite rising energy prices, inflation, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, plus the impact of growing geopolitical tensions, we remain optimistic about technology as the answer to some of the worldâ€™s biggest challenges. Our technology empowers our customers and partners to scale their sustainability impact faster across the backbone of our economies. As we approach a critical tipping point for our planet, the demand to accelerate the digital and sustainability transformations has never been greater.
