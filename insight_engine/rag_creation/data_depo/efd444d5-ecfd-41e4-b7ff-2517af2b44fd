For our approach to and governance for managing climate- related risks and opportunities, please see our reporting on TASK FORCE ON CLIMATEREL ATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD) .

We have pledged to aim to make an important contribution to the decarbonization of the global economy. We aim to reach this goal with the assistance of an appropriate gover- nance structure, including strategy and risk management, and by acting in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our commitment to the initiatives RE100 (COMPLETE CONVERSION TO RENEWABLE ELECTRICIT Y), EV100 (CONVERSION OF THE VEHICLE FLEET TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES), and EP100 (NET ZERO EMISSION BUILDINGS) further supports us in our efforts to achieve our decarbonization targets.
