Climate change is also having an impact on water supply. Water is one of humanityâ€™s most important resources. For this reason, Siemens has been analyzing water scarcity, water pollution, local fire risks, climate change, and flooding and precipitation patterns at our sites for several years. We consider these analyses in our business decisions: for example, when we select the location for a new site or implement precautionary measures.
