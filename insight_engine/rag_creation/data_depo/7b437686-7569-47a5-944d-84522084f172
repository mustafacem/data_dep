Alignment assessment at Siemens In the next step, Siemens’ Taxonomy-eligible activities were

evaluated against the technical screening criteria for Sub- stantial Contribution (SC) and Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) according to the Delegated Acts. Siemens also needed to prove its compliance with Minimum Safeguards: namely, on human rights and good business conduct rules.

Substantial Contribution (SC): Following the eligibility assessment, the alignment of all eligible business activities with the SC criteria outlined in the respective Delegated Acts was assessed. This was conducted and documented at the highest appropriate reporting hierarchy level, such as business segment, product family or project level – depending on the relevant SC criteria and the respective business activity.
