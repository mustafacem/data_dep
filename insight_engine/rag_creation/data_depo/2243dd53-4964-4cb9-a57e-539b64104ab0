SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 5

We have a clear position on responsible business conduct. And our DEGREE commitments are based on that. Ethical behavior, integrity and compliance are nonnegotiable. They go beyond strict adherence to rules by firmly placing respon- sible action sustainably at the core of our culture and busi- ness conduct.

We are also focused on our own environmental footprint: In 2015, as one of the first global companies to do so, we committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. Today, we are on track, and we have already accelerated. We are proud to have reduced our CO2 footprint from our operations by 50% (without offsetting) since 2019 and are targeting 90% in 2030. We reduced our energy consumption by 9% since fiscal 2021, meanwhile 96% of our locations have imple- mented a water strategy.
