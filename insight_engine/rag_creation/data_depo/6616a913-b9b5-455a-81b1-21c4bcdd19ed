supply chain that are associated with the production of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG). We share our findings on identified smelters with our RMI partners. The initiative then reviews the smelters’ certification. In this process, Siemens supports the smelters as they move toward the final audit and certification stage. Individual results are communicated on the RMI website WWW.RESPONSIBLE MINERALSINITIATIVE.ORG.

Siemens extends its risk assessment system to evaluate minerals beyond the 3TG grouping using the risk definitions provided by the European Commission for “armed conflict,” “areas witnessing weak or non-existent governance and security,” and “[areas with] widespread and systematic vio- lations of international law, including human rights abuses.” Cobalt and mica are two minerals that have been included in Siemens’ due diligence process. This inclusion follows the RMI’s development of an auditing standard and reporting specifications – the Extended Minerals Reporting Template (EMRT), designed specifically for cobalt and mica – in addition to the existing specifications for 3TG minerals. Siemens conducts supplier audits for cobalt and mica, with a particular focus on battery manufacturers.
