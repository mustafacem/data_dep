7.1 Reporting methodology

7.1

Reporting methodology

Sustainability is a fundamental principle that guides our every action. The Sustainability Report 2023 (below, the “Report”) supplements our financial reporting for fiscal 2023. The present chapter describes the key elements of our sustainability reporting.

Reporting approach The Report explains the strategy, organization, initiatives,

programs, management approach, targets, actions, and results of sustainable corporate governance. It supplements the financial reporting provided in the current Annual Report and updates the financial reporting from the previous year. It also documents the progress we have made in implement- ing the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the United Nations CEO Water Mandate, and the recommen- dations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
