Management approach At Siemens we are committed to creating a healthy and safe

work environment for our people and to sustainably support- ing their well-being and performance.

The world of work is changing dynamically, as are the demands and needs regarding health and safety. A core task for our occupational health and safety department is to maintain and further improve the resilience, adaptability, and well-being of our people. We believe that focusing on health and safety management reduces the risk of physical injuries and mental ill health. Siemens aims to mitigate health and safety risks effectively through management systems, designing healthy and safe working conditions, internal monitoring, and controls. Our Employee Assistance Program also supports our people in coping with psychosocial personal concerns through individual counseling. Adapting and re-designing our work systems is a continuous task. The goal is to empower our people to get involved, engage, and participate. By changing the way we work, digitalization provides the opportunity to steadily improve our health and safety assessments and management systems globally.
