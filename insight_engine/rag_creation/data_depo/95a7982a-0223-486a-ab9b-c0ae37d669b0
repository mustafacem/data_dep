laboratories, results from a combination of societal and market forces that are driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses differently. This development is driven partly by staff shortages, society’s increasing resistance to healthcare costs, the growing professionalization of health insurance and governmental healthcare systems, burdens from chronic diseases and the rapid scientific progress. The growing cost pressure will continue to drive new remuneration models for healthcare services such as value-based reimbursement instead of treatment-based reimbursement. As a result of these factors, there’s a trend of consolidation of healthcare providers into networks. The aim of the resulting larger clinic and laboratory chains, often operating internationally and acting increasingly like large corporations are systematic improvements in quality, while at the same time reducing costs. This development leads to an increased demand for standardized and scalable systems and solutions as well as new business models.
