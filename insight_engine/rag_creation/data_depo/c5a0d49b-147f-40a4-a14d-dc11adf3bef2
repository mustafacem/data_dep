The profit margin of our Industrial Business rose to 15.4%, up from 15.1% a year earlier, reaching its highest level ever. Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure achieved the strongest increases and also contributed the highest margins: 22.6% and 15.4%, respectively. The profit margin for Mobility rose slightly to 8.4%, while the profit margin at Siemens Healthineers declined to 11.7%.

Earnings before taxes at SFS increased significantly due mainly to higher earnings before taxes in the debt business, which in the prior fiscal year included a €0.2 billion impact in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia. Return on equity after tax for SFS increased to 16.3%. Profit at Portfolio Companies included a €0.1 billion gain from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business but came in sharply lower compared to the prior fiscal year which had included a €1.1 billion gain from the sale of the mail and parcel- handling business of Siemens Logistics and a €0.3 billion revaluation gain in connection with the sale of our stake in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. Results within Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements benefited from positive effects related to Siemens Energy Investment, including €1.6 billion from a partial reversal of the prior-year €2.7 billion impairment on Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG. These positive effects were partly offset by Siemens’ share of Siemens Energy’s after-tax loss.
