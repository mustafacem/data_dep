Independent Auditorâ€™s Reports (Group)

Assurance conclusion

Based on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the EU Taxonomy disclosure of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft for the period from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the interpretation by management as disclosed in the EU Taxonomy disclosure.
