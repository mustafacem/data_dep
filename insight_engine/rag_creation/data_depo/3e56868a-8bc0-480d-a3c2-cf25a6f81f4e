8.4 Opportunities

Within our ERM we regularly identify, evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity. Below we describe our most significant opportunities. Unless otherwise stated, the opportunities described relate to all organizational units. The order in which the opportunities are presented reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these opportunities and thus provides an indication of the opportunitiesâ€™ current importance to us. The described opportunities are not necessarily the only ones we encounter. In addition, our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company, our markets and technologies are constantly advancing. It is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.
