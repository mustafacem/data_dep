Siemens maintains an unmatched diversified global industrial portfolio, with operations across multiple end markets, including building technologies, mobility, digitalization, and automation. Its portfolio also includes activities unrelated to the industrial investment cycle, particularly health care. The group's applications across short-cycle and long-cycle segments and increasing share of recurring revenue give it a resilient business mix, which ensures some earnings stability during the economic cycle. This was notable during the recessionary environment in 2020 and in the current, rather muted, economic environment.
