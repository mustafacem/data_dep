The lines of credit, and the relevant loan agreements mentioned above provide their respective lenders with a right of termination in the event that (1) Siemens AG becomes a subsidiary of another company or (2) a person or a group of persons acting in concert acquires effective control over Siemens AG by being able to exercise decisive influence over its activities (Art. 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) 139/2004).

Framework agreements concluded by Siemens AG under International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. documentation (ISDA Agreements) grant each counterparty a right of termination, including in certain cases of (i) a transformation (for example mergers and changes of form), (ii) an asset transfer or (iii) acquisition of ownership interests that enables the acquirer to exercise control over Siemens AG or its controlling bodies. Partially this right of termination exists only, if (1) the resulting entity fails to simultaneously assume Siemens AG’s obligations under the ISDA Agreements or (2) the resulting entity’s creditworthiness is materially weaker than Siemens AG’s immediately prior to such event. Generally, ISDA Agreements are designed such that upon termination all outstanding payment claims documented under them are to be netted.
