4.4 EU taxonomy

KPI results for the reporting year The key performance indicators in this section were deter-

mined based on Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 in conjunction with the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on the eligibility and alignment assess- ments described above, the baseline values for revenue, capital expenditures (CapEx), and operating expenditures (OpEx) were analyzed and, if applicable, mapped to the respective EU Taxonomy activities. Allocations were also applied based on eligible and/or aligned revenue in order to link capital expenditures and operating expenditures to the respective activities. Siemens implemented a supporting IT tool for the EU Taxonomy technical eligibility and alignment assessments and associated documentation. To avoid double counting, the mapping was consistently made to only one economic activity.
