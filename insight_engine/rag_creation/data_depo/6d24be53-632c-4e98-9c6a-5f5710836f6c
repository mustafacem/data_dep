Such statements are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions of Siemens’ management; many of them are therefore beyond Siemens’ control. These are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and factors, including, but not limited to those described in disclosures, in particular in the chapter Report on risks and opportunities, and including reports on expected development of the Annual Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, events of force majeure, such as pandemics, occur, or should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later date or not at all or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results, performance, or achievements of Siemens may (negatively or positively) vary materially from those described explicitly or implicitly in the relevant forward-looking statement “Notes and forward-looking statements” in the SIEMENS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023. Siemens neither intends nor assumes any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements in light of developments which differ from those anticipated.
