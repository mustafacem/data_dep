8.3 Risks

Below we describe the risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition (including effects on assets, liabilities and cash flows), results of operations and reputation. The order in which the risks are presented in each of the four categories reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these risks and thus provides an indication of the risksâ€™ current importance to us. Additional risks not known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business objectives and operations. Unless otherwise stated, the risks described below relate to all our organizational units.
