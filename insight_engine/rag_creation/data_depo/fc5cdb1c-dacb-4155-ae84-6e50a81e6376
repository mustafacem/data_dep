Generally, shares in investment funds are accounted for securities held as non-current financial assets. Exceptions were those shares which represented plan assets and therefore were not accessible by all other creditors. These shares are held exclusively for the purpose of settling liabilities arising from post-employment obligations or comparable obligations with a long-term maturity, and are to be offset against such liabilities.
