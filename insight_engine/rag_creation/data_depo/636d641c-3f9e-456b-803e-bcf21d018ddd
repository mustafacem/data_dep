Profit Industrial Business exceeded the record high of a year earlier and rose 11% to â‚¬11.4 billion. All industrial businesses except Siemens Healthineers increased their profit year-over-year. The strongest increase came from Smart Infrastructure on improvements in all its businesses, led by the electrical products and the electrification businesses. Growth at Digital Industries was driven by the automation businesses, only partly offset by a decline in profit in the software business due mainly to higher expenses related to cloud-based activities. Profit at Mobility increased in nearly all businesses and included positive trailing effects related to the winding down of business activities in Russia a year earlier. Profit at Siemens Healthineers came in lower on declines in the diagnostics business, due primarily to sharply lower revenue from rapid coronavirus antigen tests as well as charges related to its transformation program and charges related to refocusing certain activities in the advanced therapies business.
