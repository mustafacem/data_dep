9. Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and investor relations

Shareholders exercise their rights at the Annual Share holders’ Meeting. An ordinary Annual Shareholders’ Meet ing normally takes place within the first five months of each fiscal year. The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting de cides, among other things, on the appropriation of net income, the ratification of the acts of the members of the Managing and Supervisory Boards, and the appointment of the independent auditors. Amendments to the Articles of Association and measures that change the Company’s capital stock are approved at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and implemented by the Managing Board. The Managing Board facilitates shareholder participation in this meeting through electronic communications – in par ticular, via the Internet – and enables shareholders who are unable to attend the meeting to vote by proxy. Proxies can also be reached during the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. Furthermore, shareholders may exercise their right to vote in writing or by means of electronic commu nications (absentee voting). The Managing Board may enable shareholders to participate in the Annual Share holders’ Meeting without the need to be present at the venue and without a proxy and to exercise some or all of their rights fully or partially by means of electronic com munications. The Company enables shareholders to follow the entire Annual Shareholders’ Meeting via the Internet.
