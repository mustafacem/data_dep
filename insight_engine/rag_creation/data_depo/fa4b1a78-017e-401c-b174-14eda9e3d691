Against this backdrop, the Supervisory Board focused intensively in fiscal 2023 on the execution of Siemens’ growth strategy. Siemens Xcelerator, our open digital business platform, gained more and more momentum and is the key element of Siemens’ strategy to combine the real and the digital worlds. The business opportunities created by digitalization and sustainability as well as the DEGREE sustainability framework were likewise priorities. In addition, the elections at the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting enabled the Supervisory Board to successfully further develop its own profile of skills and expertise, particularly in the areas of technology and sustainability. Today, our Supervisory Board is more global and more diverse than ever before – and, as a result, excellently positioned to optimally support the Company also in the next phases of its development.
