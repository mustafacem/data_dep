Progress on DEGREE ambition #5: Long-term incentives based on ESG criteria

Siemens grants long-term variable compensation in the form of Stock Awards. Long-term variable compensation represents at least 30% and at most 42% of total target compensation. Since fiscal 2020, allocated Stock Awards depend on a comparison of total shareholder return (TSR) with an international sector index (the MSCI World Industrials Index) and on an internal ESG/Sustainability index, weighted at 20%, with three equally weighted indicators. The ESG indicators reflect relevant strategic and socio-political topics. For the Stock Awards Tranche 2023, which was awarded in November 2022, these indicators include CO2e emissions, digital learning hours, and the Net Promoter Score (NPS) for measuring customer satisfaction. These criteria are applicable to Managing Board members of Siemens AG and all senior managers globally who are eligible for Stock Awards.
