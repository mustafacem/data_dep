Stock awards not subject to performance conditions

Each quarter, the Company grants stock awards not subject to performance conditions to selected employees. The awards are subject to a ratable vesting period of one to four years, i.e. 25% of the number of awards granted are transferred each year.

The weighted average fair value of stock awards granted in fiscal 2023 and 2022 of €125.42 and €125.29 per share, respectively, was determined as Siemens’ share price, less the present value of expected dividends during the respective vesting period.
