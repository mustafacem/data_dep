Consolidated Financial Statements

Siemens’ share price of €133.66 and €153.58. Expected volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-free interest rate of up to 2.68% and (0.23)% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and an expected dividend yield of 3.18% in fiscal 2023 and 2.61% in fiscal 2022. Assumptions relating to correlations between the Siemens share price and the development of the MSCI Index were derived from historic observations of share price and index changes. The fair value of the ESG component of €120.28 and €140.52 per share in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, was determined as Siemens’ share price, less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.
