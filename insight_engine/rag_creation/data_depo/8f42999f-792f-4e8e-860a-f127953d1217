The increase in equity was due to net income for the year of €4.5 billion and the transfer of €0.6 billion in treasury shares to employees in connection with our share-based payment programs. These factors were partly offset by dividends paid in fiscal 2023 (for fiscal 2022) of €3.4 billion and share buybacks during the year amounting to €0.9 billion. The equity ratio as of September 30, 2023 increased to 21%, from 19% a fiscal year earlier. For the disclosures in accordance with Section 160 para. 1 no. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act about treasury shares, refer to Note 15 of our Notes to Annual Financial Statements for fiscal 2023.
