RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE AUDITOR Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited

assurance on the report based on our assurance engagement.

We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Company’s report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI criteria.
