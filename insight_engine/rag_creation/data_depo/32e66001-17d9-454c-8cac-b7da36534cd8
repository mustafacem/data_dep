Actions and results

Environmental management standards and systems Our environmental management is based on the ISO 14001

and 50001 standards for energy-intensive business units and on the IEC 62430 norm for the environmentally compatible design of products, systems, solutions, and services.

Our own mandatory standard aims to ensure the implemen- tation of these norms, stating that all Siemensâ€™ sites are required to have an environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001. Sites must also operate in com- pliance with existing local environmental regulations and our internal environmental guidelines. Internal environmen- tal audits are conducted at least once per year to assess and monitor environmental protection at our sites.
