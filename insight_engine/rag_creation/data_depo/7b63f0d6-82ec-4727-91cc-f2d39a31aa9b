Auditor’s response: During our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, we examined the processes implemented by Siemens for identifying, assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. To determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted also in connection with joint and several liability are known and to assess management’s estimates of the expected cash outflows, our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the Company entrusted with these matters, obtaining written statements from in-house legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability, obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements concerning the accounting treatment in the annual financial statements. Furthermore, we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.
