The compensation awarded and due to the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members in each fiscal year is presented in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Pension payments to former members of the Managing Board are not listed here since they do not depend on Siemensâ€˜ profit development.

The presentation of average employee compensation is based on the size of the workforce, including trainees, employed by Siemens in Germany. In fiscal 2023, this workforce comprised on average 70,984 employees (full-time equivalent). By way of comparison, the Siemens Group had about 254,000 employees and trainees worldwide as of September 30, 2023. The figures exclude the workforce of Siemens Healthineers, which is not included in the presentation since it is a separately managed, publicly listed company.
