At Siemens, we take a zero-tolerance approach to corruption and other breaches of applicable laws and of our Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs).

Our BCGs contain the behavioral principles and rules that guide our conduct, both within Siemens and in our stake- holder relationships. They also serve as an expression of our values and lay the foundation for detailed internal regula- tions. The BCGs are binding for all Siemens employees around the world.

3.1 Compliance and ethics

We also believe that acting on the basis of our Ethical Princi- ples allows us to focus even more on responsible business practices. We aspire to support the sustainable development of Siemens and the societies where we operate by adhering to responsible business practices.
