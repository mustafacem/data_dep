5.2 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

Inclusion of people with disabilities Siemens strives to ensure equity for people with disabilities,

their inclusion in society and the workplace, their self-deter- mined participation, and their right to be treated with respect. At Siemens, we believe that each person is of value and importance, regardless of their ability. And while we aim for a barrier-free work environment at Siemens, inclusion means more than just accessibility. It is a holistic way of thinking and acting that eliminates both visible and invisible barriers and encourages a culture of conscious, equitable participation and understanding. We believe that this way of thinking supports and enables people with disabilities to be included and to give their best.
