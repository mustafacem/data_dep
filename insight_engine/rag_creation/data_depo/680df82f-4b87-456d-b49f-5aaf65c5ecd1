SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 36

Compliance risk management To be effective, the Siemens compliance system needs to be

continuously adjusted in order to meet business-specific risks and multiple local legal requirements. The findings from compliance risk assessments, along with compliance controls and audits, help us identify opportunities to further develop the compliance system.

The goal of compliance risk management is to detect compli- ance risks early and take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate risks. Risk assessments and tool solutions that support risk evaluations are also integrated into individual business processes to support our employees in taking appropriate risk mitigation steps.
