1 The R11 equivalent is a measure of ozone depletion potential

We reduced our VOC emissions by another 9% from the previous year to 250 metric tons in fiscal 2023. Total ODS emissions increased slightly, amounting to 0.044 metric tons in fiscal 2023.

We determined the quantity of nitrogen oxides in our relevant thermal processes with the aid of computational procedures, assuming typical combustion conditions. For fiscal 2023, this yielded a figure of 53 metric tons for our environmen- tally relevant sites compared to 58 metric tons the year before. This figure includes nitrogen oxides that are released by burning the fuels listed under primary energy.
