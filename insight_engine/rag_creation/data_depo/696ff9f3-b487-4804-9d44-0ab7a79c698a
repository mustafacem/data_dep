The WeTu social enterprise in Kenya The WeTu social enterprise founded by Siemens Stiftung

works on innovative solutions for supplying energy and drinking water to communities in Western Kenya near Lake Victoria. Its WeWater unit operates 13 water dispensing stations at various locations that supply the surrounding rural communities with safe, filtered drinking water at economical prices.

In a multistage process, surface water is processed through various prefilters, an ultra-filtration membrane, and finally UV disinfection. Drinking water is dispensed around the clock by way of a cashless ATM system. This approach supplies more than 3 million liters of drinking water to 16,000 people. A variety of social marketing measures also alert customers about how contamination can occur in home use and how contaminated drinking water affects health.
