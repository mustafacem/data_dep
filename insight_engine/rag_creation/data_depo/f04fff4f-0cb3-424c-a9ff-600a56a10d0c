Guarantees and other commitments: Siemens AG issues parent company guarantees, i.e. guarantees to ensure performance obligations incurred from the delivery of goods or provision of services by affiliated and long-term investee companies or their parent companies. For measurement purposes, the contract amount of the secured delivery or service agreement is reduced using the straight-line method over the planned term of the delivery or service agreement, unless there are reasons for a different risk assessment and an increased liability amount (“risk-adequate liability amount”). Credit lines included in the guarantee obligations in the context of financing affiliated companies are recognized at their nominal amount.
