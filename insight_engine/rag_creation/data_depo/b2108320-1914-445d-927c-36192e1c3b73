Average employee compensation comprises the personnel costs for wages and salaries, fringe benefits, employer contributions to social insurance and any short-term variable compensation components attributable to the fiscal year. For compensation in connection with share plans, the amounts received in the fiscal year are taken into account. Therefore, employee compensation is also equivalent, in principle, to awarded and due compensation within the meaning of Section 162 para. 1 sent. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and is thus in line with Managing Board and Supervisory Board compensation.
