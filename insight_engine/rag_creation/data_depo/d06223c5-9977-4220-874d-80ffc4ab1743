With our New-Normal Working Model, emissions from the use of our buildings and commuting will be reduced, while emissions from working from home increase. In total, we calculated emissions from category 3.7, Employee Commut- ing, at 105 thousand metric tons of CO2e, while emissions created by working from home amounted to 24 thousand metric tons of CO2e, largely due to using IT equipment. For more details, see WORKING AT SIEMENS.

Using an internal CO2e price In the UK and Brazil, we are currently using an internal CO2e price to manage our decarbonization activities. In the UK, we raised the price per ton of CO2e in fiscal 2023 to GBP50 from GBP40 to create a clear pathway to increasing CO2e costs. A major portion of the proceeds is being used to expand the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles at our new office location in Farnborough, UK. In Brazil, a so-called shadow price of US$240 per ton of CO2e was established to support energy efficiency in buildings and factories and, for example, to support electrification of the motor vehicle fleet.
