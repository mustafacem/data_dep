Credit risks: We provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects, including guarantees. Siemens Financial Services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activities if, for example, customers do not meet obligations arising from these financing arrangements, meet them only partially, or meet them late. The credit environment has become more dynamic due to a more uncertain macroeconomic outlook (e.g. inflation) and geopolitical tensions.
