Scope 3 downstream emissions With regard to Scope 3 downstream emissions, we calculated

these emissions in fiscal 2023 in line with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, and therefore accounted for and reported the emissions from the use of Siemens offerings sold or investments made in the reporting year over their entire use phase duration. For calculating these emissions, in most cases we apply the global power-mix emissions factor defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA). For calculating the emissions of end products and key compo- nents of end products (intermediate products), we apply the so-called “final product approach” defined in the GHG Protocol. This means that in the case of motors, for example, we take into account their power loss as well as their effective power. If we applied the “intermediate product approach” to all intermediate products – an approach that in the example of motors only takes into account their power loss – the
