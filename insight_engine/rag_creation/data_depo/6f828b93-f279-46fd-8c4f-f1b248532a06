The Supervisory Board and the Managing Board propose to distribute a dividend of €4.70 per share of no par value entitled to the dividend, from the unappropriated net income of Siemens AG for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 amounting to €3.8 billion. The proposed dividend represents a total payout of €3.7 billion based on the estimated number of shares entitled to dividend at the date of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. This includes striving for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or at least matches it. For fiscal 2024, we expect that net income of Siemens AG will be sufficient to fund the distribution of a commensurate dividend.
