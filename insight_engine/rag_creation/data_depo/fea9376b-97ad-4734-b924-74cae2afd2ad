Stage 1: At inception, twelve-month expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.

Stage 2: If the credit risk of a financial asset increases significantly without being credit-impaired, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized based on a lifetime probability of default. A significant increase in credit risk is determined for each individual financial instrument using internal credit ratings. A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage 2, if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. More than 30 days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage 2, if the delay is not credit-risk- related.
