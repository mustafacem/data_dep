Consolidated Financial Statements

Switzerland

Following the Swiss law of occupational benefits (BVG) each employer has to grant post-employment benefits for qualifying employees. Accordingly, Siemens in Switzerland sponsors several cash balance plans. These plans are administered by external foundations. The board of the main foundation is composed of equally many employer and employee representatives. The board of the foundation is responsible for investment policy and asset management, as well as for any changes in the plan rules and the determination of contributions to finance the benefits. The Company is required to make total contributions at least as high as the sum of the employee contributions set out in the plan rules. In case of an underfunded plan the Company together with the employees may be asked to pay supplementary contributions according to a well-defined framework of recovery measures.
