Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR): number of lost-time cases (LTC) × 200,000 / work hours; LTC are accidents that result in at least one lost day of work. As a globally operating company, Siemens isn’t always authorized or able to obtain sensitive information about contract workers‘ health and occupational safety or complete figures on their work hours. As a result, the Temporary Worker LTIFR for Siemens includes only temporary workers hired by a temporary employment agency or under a contract for work and services.
