The increase in Basic EPS and in EPS pre PPA reflects the increase of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was €7,949 million in fiscal 2023 compared to €3,723 million in fiscal 2022, combined with a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding. Our investment in Siemens Energy AG contributed €0.84 to the increase of EPS pre PPA.

At 18.6%, ROCE was back in the target range established in our Siemens Financial Framework. The increase year-over-year was due primarily to sharply higher income before interest after tax.
