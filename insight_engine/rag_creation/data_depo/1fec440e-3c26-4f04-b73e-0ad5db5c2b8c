Climate risks in the risk management system The consideration of sustainability and climate-related risks

and opportunities is an integral part of our regular top-down process that communicates material issues and trends at risk workshops to the relevant company units so they can identify risks and opportunities. As a result, issue-related recommen- dations are available to all businesses at their quarterly reviews. In fiscal 2023, several climate-related topics were on the agenda of the top-down process, which then provided input to the annual ERM process on topics that included physical climate risks, increasing regulation, and the trans- parency of environmental product data.
