SUPERVISORY BOARD SELF-ASSESSMENT

The Supervisory Board and its committees regularly con duct reviews – either internally or with the involvement of external consultants – in order to determine how efficiently they perform their duties. In fiscal 2023, the Supervisory Board conducted an internal selfassess ment. At its meeting on September 22, 2023, the Super visory Board concerned itself intensively with the results of the assessment and the measures to be derived from it. The results of the assessment confirm that coopera tion within the Supervisory Board and with the Manag ing Board is professional, constructive and characterized by a high degree of trust and openness. The results also confirm that meetings are organized and conducted efficiently and that the participants receive sufficient information. The composition and structure of the Super visory Board, including the structure and mecha nisms of its committees, were assessed as effective and efficient. The review did not reveal a need for any funda mental changes. Individual suggestions for improvement
