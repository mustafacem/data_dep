Valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Since the spin-off of Siemens Energy AG in September 2020, Siemens AG has held a 35.1% stake in the listed Siemens Energy AG which was reduced to 25.1% due to capital measures at Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of shares in Siemens Energy AG to the Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. in fiscal year 2023. The investment is accounted for as an associate, applying the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. As of June 30, 2022, an impairment was recognized on the investment. During the first six months of the financial year 2023, the market capitalization of the investment was mostly higher than the value at the time of the impairment. As of March 31, 2023, the latter was significantly exceeded. As a result, an impairment reversal was made in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, in the amount of the increase in the stock market price since the date of the impairment until March 31, 2023. In addition, Siemens Energy AG acquired additional shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. in fiscal year 2023. This led to a reduction in equity in the consolidated financial statements of Siemens Energy AG. The recognition of Siemens’ share in this equity transaction resulted in a reduction of the carrying amount of the investment in Siemens Energy AG, which was recognized directly in Siemens’ equity. As of September 30, 2023, the pro rata market value of the investment was above the book value.
