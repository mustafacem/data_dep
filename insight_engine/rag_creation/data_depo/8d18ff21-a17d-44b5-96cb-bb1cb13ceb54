→ Country risk levels: Suppliers are assigned to risk levels based on country-specific sustainability indicators in areas like legal compliance, corruption and bribery, human rights in the workplace, and child labor.

We centralize sustainability-related data about our suppliers on the SCM Sustainability Platform, which enables us to gather information from diverse internal and external sources. This includes data on carbon reduction initiatives, corporate responsibility self-assessments (CRSA), on-site audit results, and risks associated with conflict minerals. All employees in Siemens’ purchasing departments can access this integrated tool.
