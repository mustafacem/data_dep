Globally, the decline of inflation rates is expected to continue, although at a slower pace. Past interest rate hikes are having the desired effect, and headline inflation is expected to steadily approach the central bank targets. Hence, monetary policy is expected to become less restrictive in calendar 2024.

Global fixed investments should benefit from government programs and from factory investments to improve supply chain resilience and other diversification measures. Global gross fixed investments are expected to grow by 3.2% in calendar 2024, unchanged from 3.2% in the year before.
