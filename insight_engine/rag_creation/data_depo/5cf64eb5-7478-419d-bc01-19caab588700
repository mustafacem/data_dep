3.1 Overall economic conditions

Overall, calendar 2023 was characterized by many headwinds for the global economy. Global economic development continued to slowly recover from the negative shocks of the previous years: the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) with its disruptions on global demand and supply chains; war in Ukraine and the following commodity price explosions, especially for European energy; spiraling inflation and severe financial tightening which caused some turbulence in the banking sector and financial markets. After calendar 2022, in which global gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 3.1%, calendar 2023 is expected to show global GDP increasing by 2.6%, which shows a remarkable resilience of the global economy, given the number of big negative shocks of the previous year.
