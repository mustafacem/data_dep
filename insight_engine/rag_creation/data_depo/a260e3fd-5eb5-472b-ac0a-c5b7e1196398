Commitment to human rights and international standards The principle of respect for human rights is firmly grounded

in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop- ment. Siemens believes that the 17 Sustainability Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) can only be fully achieved if potentially negative impacts within the value chains are examined in detail and effective action is taken to counter them. In these efforts, we are guided by international standards that help companies define their approaches to human rights and continuously optimize them. These standards include the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). They highlight the importance of due diligence systems that proactively identify, assess, and mitigate potential adverse human rights impacts.
