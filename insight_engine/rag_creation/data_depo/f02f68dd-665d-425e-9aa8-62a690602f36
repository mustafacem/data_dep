4.2 Conserving resources

Efficient waste management The environmental relevance of waste depends on the type

of waste and the method used for its disposal. To reduce hazardous waste, we work on increasing our material recy- cling rate and reducing our landfill waste. To enhance material efficiency in our production processes, we imple- ment practices like regrinding sprue parts at plastic molding sites.

To support resource efficiency in production, our sites track waste data using a standard process that undergoes regular audits that aim to ensure accuracy and compliance. In addi- tion, we distinguish between hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The treatment of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is further subdivided into material recycling, thermal recovery, thermal disposal, and landfill. Waste flows from construction or demolition work are reported separately, because these waste categories are created independent of production. We then go beyond the monitoring of our own activities to analyze the waste generated throughout our upstream supply chain.
