Reducing building emissions Regarding building emissions, we are committed to only

owning and occupying assets that are net zero carbon in operation by the year 2030 as part of our EP100 pledge. We plan to achieve this goal through various measures, includ- ing building new CO2-neutral buildings, modernizing existing buildings, and leasing office space that produces the lowest possible emissions. Once we have exhausted all possible measures, we plan to purchase high-quality carbon offsets to compensate for the remaining emissions. Today 37 of our locations have no net CO2e emissions during regular operation.
