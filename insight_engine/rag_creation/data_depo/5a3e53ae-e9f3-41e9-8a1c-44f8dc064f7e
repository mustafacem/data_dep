The fair value less costs to sell is mainly driven by the terminal value, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the terminal value growth rate and discount rate. Both assumptions are determined individually for each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Siemens Financial Servicesâ€™ discount rate represents its specific cost of equity. The discount rates are calculated based on a risk-free rate of interest and a market risk premium. In addition, the discount rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cash-generating unit or group of cash- generating units by taking into account specific peer group information on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt as well as country specific premiums. The parameters for calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of information. The peer group is subject to an annual review and adjusted, if necessary. Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data and industry specific trends.
