Preventing money laundering and terrorism financing Siemens strives to only maintain business relationships with

reputable customers, suppliers, partners, and companies whose business activities comply with legal requirements and whose financial resources are of legitimate origin. We use a risk-based approach to verify the identity and economic background of customers, suppliers, business partners, and other third parties and the origin of payments to ensure they come from legitimate sources. When necessary, Siemens reports suspicious activities to law enforcement authorities.
