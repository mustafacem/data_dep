7.4 Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Furthermore, during this fiscal year, we conducted compre- hensive global training sessions, featuring the participation of qualified external specialists, aimed at strengthening our business continuity management and standardizing our business impact analysis, particularly in the context of natural hazards. These initiatives also consider anticipated changes in risk exposures due to climate change.

Our decision-making process for selecting new locations and devising sustainable, long-term protective measures is based on an exhaustive risk analysis, with a particular emphasis on natural hazards. This includes an in-depth examination and modeling of current risk factors and future climate scenarios, facilitating the formulation of proactive measures. In addi- tion to the assessment of physical risks, we engage in transparent dialogues with partners to comprehensively evaluate transitional risks, such as regulatory changes, thereby encompassing associated risks and opportunities.
