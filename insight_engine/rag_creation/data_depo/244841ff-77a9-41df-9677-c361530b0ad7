7.1 Reporting methodology

Methodology, environmental reporting, and collection of environmental data Within our environmental information system, in fiscal 2023

we evaluated 250 reports from locations in all relevant countries where defined threshold values for environmental management parameters like energy usage, resource usage, water consumption, and emissions were exceeded. We use absolute values – for example, energy consumption in giga- joules – to measure and monitor our environmental impacts. We report environmental data for ongoing operations.
