Associates and joint ventures – Associates are companies over which Siemens has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirect ownership of 20% to 50% of the voting rights). Joint ventures are entities over which Siemens and one or more parties have joint control. Joint control requires unanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on relevant activities.

Associates and joint ventures are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. If the investment was retained in a transaction in which Siemens lost control of a subsidiary, the fair value of the investment represents the cost on initial recognition. Siemens’ share of its associate’s or joint venture’s post-acquisition profits or losses is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and its share of post-acquisition changes in equity that have not been recognized in the associate’s or joint venture’s profit or loss is recognized directly in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes also include effects from fair value adjustments and are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When Siemens’ share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the investment, Siemens does not recognize further losses, unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. The interest in an associate or joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of Siemens’ net investment in the associate or joint venture.
