On a quarterly basis, we execute an internal certification process. Management at different levels of our organization, supported by confirmations by managements of entities under their responsibility, confirms the accuracy of the financial data that has been reported to Siemensâ€™ corporate headquarters and reports on the effectiveness of the related control systems.

Siemens Healthineers is subject to our Group-wide principles for the accounting-related internal control and risk management system and is responsible for adhering to those principles.
