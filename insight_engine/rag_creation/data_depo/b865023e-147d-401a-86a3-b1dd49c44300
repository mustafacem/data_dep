The integration of Varian into our accounting-related ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2023 and was completed to a very large extent with regard to all Varian entities. The integration measures are planned to be completely finalized in fiscal 2024.

Our internal audit function systematically reviews our financial reporting integrity, our accounting-related ICS and ERM. Siemens Healthineers has its own internal audit department and annual audit plan (see also 8.5.1). The Audit Committee is integrated into our accounting-related ICS. In particular, it oversees the accounting and accounting process and the adequacy and effectiveness of the associated ICS, the ERM and the internal audit system. Moreover, we have rules for accounting-related complaints.
