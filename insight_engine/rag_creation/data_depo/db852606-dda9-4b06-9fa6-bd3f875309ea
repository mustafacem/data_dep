We establish water targets at multiple sites to account for the specific local environment and to drive effective mitigation measures. At the corporate level, we have implemented a defined water strategy, and have conducted risk assessments to shape local water targets.

Our individual sites then implement their own water initia- tives in alignment with these targets. For instance, by greening the roofs of our Siemens Campus in Erlangen, we return rainwater back into the natural water cycle through evaporation, rather than disposing of it in the sewer system.
