Provided the relevant conditions are met, derivative financial instruments are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. Using the freezing method, the hedging transactions are not recognized in the balance sheet. The effectiveness of the valuation unit is either ensured through risk management, or is demonstrated both prospectively and retrospectively based on appropriate methods used to demonstrate effectiveness (e.g. dollar offset method, regression method, sensitivity analysis). Valuation gains and losses from derivative financial instruments and hedged items are netted for each valuation unit. A provision for anticipated losses on onerous contracts is recognized for the respective valuation unit in the amount of an existing loss surplus. Profit surpluses are not recognized.
