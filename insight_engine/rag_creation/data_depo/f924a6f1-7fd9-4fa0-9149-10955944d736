In fiscal 2023, orders and revenue increased in all businesses. While order growth was driven by higher volume from larger orders, most evidently at the Airport Logistics business of Siemens Logistics, revenue increased mainly at Large Drives Applications in part due to strong conversion of the order backlog. Primarily due to the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, portfolio effects took eleven and 13 percentage points from orders and revenue, respectively. The strong profit was driven by Siemens Energy Assets and Large Drives Applications. Additionally, Portfolio Companies recorded a gain of €0.1 billion from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business. For comparison, profit in fiscal 2022 included a gain of €1.1 billion from the sale of the mail and parcel-handling business of Siemens Logistics and a revaluation gain of €0.3 billion in connection with the sale of the equity investment in Valeo Siemens eAutomotive GmbH. Portfolio Companies recorded lower severance charges of €12 million, down from €20 million in fiscal 2022.
