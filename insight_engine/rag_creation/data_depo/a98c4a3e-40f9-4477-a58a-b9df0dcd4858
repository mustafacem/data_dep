Our governance and policies for strategic procurement The core objectives of the strategic procurement processes are

to sustain the companyâ€™s success by making a consistently high contribution to our earnings from purchases of materials and services, to assert high quality standards along the entire supply chain, to identify and exploit opportunities to create value through procurement competence, and to ensure compliance and sustainability. Sustainability is our guiding principle. The sustainability initiatives we take are an essential aspect of the successful implementation of our programs. Our understanding of sustainability in the supply chain is based on our company values to be responsible, excellent and innova- tive. As a Support Function in the Service and Governance units, Siemens Supply Chain Management has the process and regulation responsibilities for procurement principles.
