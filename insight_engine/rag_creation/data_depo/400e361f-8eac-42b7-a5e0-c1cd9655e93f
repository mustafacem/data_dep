We firmly believe that promoting diversity in the workforce serves the interests of both society and Siemens itself. Diversity reinforces our innovative strength, unleashes employee potential, and directly contributes to our business success. Our human resources management also supports a transformation in top management, where there is room for improvement. We are recruiting more women for top mana- gerial positions and are including more women in network- ing activities, trainings, and mentoring programs. Without SHS, Siemens aims to have 30% of its top management positions worldwide filled by women by 2025.
