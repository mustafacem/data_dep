Our Base-Case Scenario

Assumptions

- Globally, we expect real economic growth to slow from 3.3% in 2023 to 3.0% in 2024 and a rebound to 3.3% in 2025. For the eurozone, we expect GDP growth of about 0.8% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025, after growth of 0.6% in 2023. In China, we forecast GDP growth will reduce to 4.6% in 2024 and 4.8% in 2025 from 5.4% in 2023. In the U.S., we forecast GDP growth to decelerate to about 1.5% in 2024 and 1.4% in 2025 from 2.4% in 2023.

- We forecast revenue growth of 4%-6% in fiscals 2024 and 2025, based on the strong order book growth seen over the past 12 months. The order backlog position of about â‚¬111 billion at the end of fiscal 2023 provides good revenue visibility.
