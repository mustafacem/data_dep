The U.S. economy is expected to decelerate to a soft landing. After unexpectedly strong GDP growth (expected to be +2.5%) in calendar 2023, caused mainly by a very strong services sector while industry was weak, growth in calendar 2024 is expected to slow down to 1.6%. Tighter financial conditions – the Federal Reserve increased the main policy interest rate to 5.5% and longer-term interest rates also increased substantially – will unfold their full effect next year. Hence, a short and shallow recession during calendar 2024, while not our baseline assumption, is also possible and expected by some economists. Consumer spending is expected to continue as a primary growth driver, while government investment programs (CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act) play a supporting role for the economy as they spur business investment.
