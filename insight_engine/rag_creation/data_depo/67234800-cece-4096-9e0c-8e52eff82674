Siemens Energy's 1Q Expected Overshadowed by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy Woes -- Market Talk

10 January 2024 12:08 CET

1108 GMT - Siemens Energy is expected to disclose a strong order intake of EUR12.6 billion when it reports its first fiscal quarter in February, but the quarter should also reflect continuing issues with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, Deutsche Bank analyst Gael de-Bray says in a research note. "Operationally, the quarter should be a depiction of an all-too-familiar tale of significant losses and free cash outflows for SGRE, which will, once again, overshadow the solid performance of the group's other businesses," the analyst says. Siemens's EUR2.1 billion purchase from Siemens Energy of a 18% stake in Siemens Ltd. India has helped Siemens Energy's balance sheet, but the analyst says that execution risks haven't fully gone away. Siemens Energy shares trade 0.58% higher to EUR12.08. (pierre.bertrand@wsj.com)
