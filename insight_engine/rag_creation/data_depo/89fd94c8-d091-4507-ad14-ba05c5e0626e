Emissions produced in the use phase of our products will continuously decrease over time due to new product gener- ations and to the ongoing transition to renewable energies in our users’ markets.

The use of our products sold in fiscal 2023 will generate 469 million metric tons of CO2e over the entire expected product use phase (Scope 3.11 Use of sold products). We are using a constant emission factor over the anticipated prod- uct use phase. Our scope 3 emissions increased due to an expansion of the reported portfolio as well as increased sales volumes. We use the final product calculation method. If we applied the intermediate approach instead, emissions from the use of our products sold in fiscal 2023 would be consid- erably lower. These emissions are primarily created by the electricity used and the product’s lifespan.
