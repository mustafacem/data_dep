Target achievement: 200.00%

“Managing Board portfolio” target dimension

The Supervisory Board of Siemens AG established “profitability / capital efficiency” measured in terms of return on capital employed (ROCE) as the performance criterion for the “Managing Board portfolio” target dimension for fiscal 2023 for all Managing Board members. ROCE is defined as profit before interest and after tax divided by average capital employed. For the purposes of target setting and determining target achievement, ROCE – as defined in the Siemens Financial Framework, which excludes certain Varian-related acquisition effects – is adjusted for main effects relating to the stake in Siemens Energy (profit “Siemens Energy Investment” in the numerator and asset “Siemens Energy Investment” in the denominator). The target value for ROCE adjusted is derived from budget planning.
