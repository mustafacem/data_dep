SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 102

Siemens believes that it is important to work for the good of society beyond our business activities and to invest in charitable work. This belief is anchored in our Corporate Citizenship Strategy. Our principles serve as a global frame- work and provide guidance for local sponsorship activities, donations, charitable contributions, and memberships. This guidance defines how a variety of potential contributions can be deployed connecting each one to our overarching principles.
