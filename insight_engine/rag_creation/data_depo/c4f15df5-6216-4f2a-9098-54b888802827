SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 55

Holistic environmental protection

Siemens governs all relevant ecological considerations through our Environmental Protection Standards. These policies enable us to oversee and improve environmental management at our sites and to involve our suppliers, service providers, and contracting partners through the Siemens Group Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Third-Party Inter- mediaries. With these policies and activities, we extend environmental protection beyond our own business opera- tions. Our environmental policies also include a commitment to increasingly mitigate the environmental impact of our products, systems, solutions, and services.
