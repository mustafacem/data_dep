Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL): a) mandatorily measured at FVTPL: Debt financial assets are measured at FVTPL if the business model they are held in is not a hold-to-collect or a hold-and-sell business model, or if their contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI-option is elected. b) Financial assets designated as measured at FVTPL are irrevocably designated at initial recognition if the designation significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains (losses) were measured on different bases.
