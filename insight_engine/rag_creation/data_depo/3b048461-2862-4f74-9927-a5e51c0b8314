Cash flow hedges

The Company’s operating units apply hedge accounting to certain significant forecast transactions and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Particularly, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. The risk mainly results from contracts denominated in US$ both from Siemens’ operating units entering into long-term contracts e.g. from the project business and from the standard product business. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the risk is hedged against the euro at an average rate of 1.2780 €/US$ and 1.2293 €/US$ (forward purchases of US$), respectively, and 1.1027 €/US$ and 1.0258 €/US$ (forward sales of US$), respectively. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the hedging transactions have an average remaining maturity until 2028 and 2027 (forward purchases of US$) as well as 2024 and 2023 (forward sales of US$), respectively.
