The Business Conduct Guidelines provide the ethical and legal framework within which we want to conduct our activities and remain on course for success. They contain the basic principles and rules for our conduct within our Company and in relation to our external partners and the general public. They set out how we meet our ethical and legal responsibility as a Company and give expression to our Company values: “Responsible” – “Excellent” – “Inno vative.” Our Business Conduct Guidelines are publicly available on the Siemens Global Website at WWW.
