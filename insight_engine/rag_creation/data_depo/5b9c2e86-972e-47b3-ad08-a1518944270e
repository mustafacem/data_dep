Eligibility assessment at Siemens The purpose of the eligibility assessment is to determine if

Siemens’ business activities fit the description of one of the economic activities specified by the EU Taxonomy. If a Siemens business activity matches, it is then classified as “eligible”. A business activity that is “non-eligible” is not within the scope of the EU Taxonomy reporting. The eligibility assessments were conducted decentrally in the businesses in an interdisciplinary manner involving experts, for instance from technical, strategy, or sustainability departments.
