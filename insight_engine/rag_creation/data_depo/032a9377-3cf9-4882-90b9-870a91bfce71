Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program

Our Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program addresses environ- mental factors specific to our products, systems, solutions, and services and our production. It also defines objectives for improving our environmental management: for example, by encouraging a circular economy and generally demateri- alizing our business processes.

1) Robust Eco Design (RED) approach: At the center of the Responsible Product Development program component is our Robust Eco Design approach.

Our aim has been to intensify the use of lifecycle assessments (LCAs) and environmental product declarations (EPDs), which will allow us to identify environmentally compatible design alternatives that take circularity into account and can be integrated into product specifications. Our ambi- tion is to apply the RED approach to all relevant products, systems, solutions, and services by 2030. This is associ- ated with our goal to increase the number of LCAs and
