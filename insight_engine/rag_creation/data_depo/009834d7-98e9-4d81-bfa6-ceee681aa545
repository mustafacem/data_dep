SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 75

Currently, up to 50% of our revenue (Siemens without SHS) comes from products, systems, solutions, and services that contain substances or groups of substances regulated by IEC 62474. We are continuously seeking ways to replace these substances whenever technically possible and reason- able.

By systematically applying our approaches to environmen- tally compatible product, system, solution, and service design and closely collaborating with our business partners, we intend to comprehensively support the replacement of declarable substances and decouple economic development from resource consumption.
