Every complaint is taken seriously. If the allegations prove to be sufficiently plausible, the Compliance organization deter- mines whether there is sufficient information to justify an internal investigation. Indications about other matters are forwarded to the affected Siemens department or business unit for further action.

Internal investigations are conducted based on binding, clearly defined standards to ensure the fair and respectful treatment of employees. These standards prohibit unlawful or disproportionate actions. However, if an internal investiga- tion leads to the finding that an employee has demonstrably violated any laws or internal regulations, they can expect appropriate disciplinary consequences.
