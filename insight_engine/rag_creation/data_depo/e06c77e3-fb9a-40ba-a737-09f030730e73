Building on the success of previous reduction initiatives, our target is to achieve a 50% reduction in landfill waste by 2025 compared to fiscal 2021 as we progress toward zero landfill waste by 2030. Additionally, we want to continuously increase our material recycling rate by 2030.1

4.2 Conserving resources

In addition to our Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program, we actively pursue resource conservation through other initia- tives. We have implemented initiatives to manage our envi- ronmental impact in areas like water, air pollutants, and biodiversity. Currently, we have specific targets for water and air pollutants at some of our sites.

The global goals of the Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program are converted into local targets and measures implemented by our sitesâ€™ environmental and energy management systems.
