SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 65

Water use in water-stressed areas can exacerbate water scarcity, degrade water quality, and harm aquatic habitats and biodiversity.

Lastly, biodiversity loss is comparable to the threat of climate change, because it can disrupt the functioning of ecosystems, creating far-reaching impacts on peopleâ€™s health and liveli- hoods.

Our governance and policies for conserving resources To mitigate these impacts, we made the responsible use of

limited resources an integral part of environmental protection at Siemens. Information on our holistic environmental pro- tection governance and policies can be found in HOLISTIC ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.
