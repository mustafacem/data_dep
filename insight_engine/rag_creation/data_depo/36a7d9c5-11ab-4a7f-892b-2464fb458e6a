Management of climate risks in our own operations

Climate change mitigation

We have set ambitious decarbonization targets that apply to Siemens’ own operations and to our upstream and down- stream value chain (see paragraph “Metrics and targets”).

The reduction of GHG emissions in our own operations is integrated into Long-term Incentive (LTI) compensation as part of an internal Siemens ESG/Sustainability Index that is applicable to members of the Managing Board and senior management (Siemens without SHS). Anchoring the reduc- tion of GHG emissions in this system and the responsibility of each of our businesses for reducing its prorated emissions are key elements of our management approach and require regular monitoring.
