Following extraordinary demand in fiscal 2022, which included proactive customer purchasing, orders at Digital Industries came in lower in its automation businesses. The short-cycle factory automation and the motion control businesses were affected most strongly due particularly to destocking at customers. These declines were partly offset by significant growth in the software business, due to large contract wins in both the PLM and the EDA businesses. Revenue rose on increases in all businesses due in part to conversion from the order backlog which had expanded significantly in the previous fiscal year. The strongest revenue growth contributions came from the factory automation and the process automation businesses. Overall, growth in the automation businesses was supported by improved availability of components year-over-year. Revenue growth in the software business was led by the EDA business while year-over-year growth in PLM was held back by the transition to SaaS. On a geographic basis, orders remained stable in the Americas region, but came in lower in the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East and in the region Asia, Australia due mainly to weaker demand in China. Revenue grew in all regions with the strongest contribution coming from the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East. Profit and profitability at Digital Industries rose on strong improvements in all automation businesses, supported by higher capacity utilization and a more favorable business mix including improved availability of components for high-margin products. Profit in the software business declined due to increased expenses related to cloud-based activities including severance charges, which for Digital Industries overall rose to €109 million, up from €64 million in the prior year.
