Therefore, we set the target for Siemens without SHS to reduce the CO2e emissions generated in our supply chain by 20% by 2030 compared to 2020, and over the long term to achieve Net Zero emissions in the supply chain by 2050. This ambition is also part of our DEGREE sustainability framework. More details on our decarbonization targets for the supply chain and DEGREE KPI can be found in SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES.

As part of our Science-Based Targets, we pledged to reduce our entire Scope 3 emissions, upstream and downstream, by 15% by 2030 compared to 2019. This target also includes the use phase of our products (Scope 3.11 Use of sold products).
