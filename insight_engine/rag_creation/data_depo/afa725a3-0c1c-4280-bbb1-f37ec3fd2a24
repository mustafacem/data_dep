To assess the relevance of GHG emissions other than CO2, they are converted into metric tons of CO2 equivalents (CO2e). This number is based on the global warming potential over 100 years of the respective greenhouse gas compared to the global warming potential of CO2.

SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 129

Baseline methodology The baseline methodology defined in the guideline refers to

the comparison of a Siemens product, system, solution, service, or investment with a reference situation in the absence of the Siemens offering. To enable credibility and avoid overstating the positive effect, the reference scenario has to represent as best as possible the situation that would have occurred without the Siemens solution.

→ Beforeandafter comparison: Refers to the difference between an initial customer situation and the situation after the implementation of a Siemens offering intended to improve or substitute certain characteristics. This com- parison can be applied, for example, to cases in which a Siemens solution optimizes a building’s energy consump- tion.
