In the E.U., GDP is expected to increase by 0.8% in calendar 2024, after an anticipated growth of 0.4% in calendar 2023. The effects of the energy crisis still show negative impacts, especially in energy-intensive industries. Tighter monetary policy – the European Central Bank lifted the main policy interest rate to 4.5% in just over one year – also held back growth, particularly in the construction industry. The German economy is most impacted due to its proportionally large manufacturing sector and is expected to grow by only 0.5% in calendar 2024.
