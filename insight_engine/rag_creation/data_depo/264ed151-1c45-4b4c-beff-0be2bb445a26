Key Account Management â€“ A holistic approach to meeting customer needs

Systematically measuring and improving customer satisfaction We use the Net Promoter Score (NPS) every year to measure

customer satisfaction, and by extension, the quality of our partnerships. Management compensation at Siemens also includes a component that is based on customer satisfaction. This component incorporates long-term performance incen- tives using ESG criteria and is defined under Governance in our DEGREE sustainability framework. The assessment is based on the internal ESG/Sustainability index, which includes the Net Promoter Score2, among others.3
