The emission of air pollutants like volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs) and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) can lead to ground-level ozone and have adverse health effects, and some are potent greenhouse gases.

While many types of waste can be recycled or reprocessed in a functioning circular economy, the production of landfill waste contributes to land use and greenhouse gas emissions, and it influences local biodiversity and can cause health problems for people and ecosystems. By fostering recycling, Siemens can also reduce potential impacts in the down- stream value chain like marine plastics pollution and in the upstream value chain from sourcing primary raw materials.
