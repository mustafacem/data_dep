Smart Infrastructure benefits from a number of major trends. These include urbanization, demographic change, decarbonization, and digitalization. Urbanization and demographic change drive a need for smarter and more human-centric buildings. Climate change drives the need for decarbonization and digitalization. This results in an increasing demand for flexible and resilient energy infrastructures including rapid growth in electric mobility and more sustainable buildings. Digitalization is an enabler for such changes in both buildings and grids, making it possible to develop smarter buildings and manage electricity distribution with a higher share of renewables. The markets served are experiencing shifts that present opportunities where building technologies and electrification meet.
