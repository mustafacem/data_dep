Our Carbon Reduction@Suppliers program In our Carbon Reduction@Suppliers program, we collaborate

with an external partner to analyze the economic data and model the carbon footprint of each of our suppliers. To facilitate this process, we utilize a web-based tool called supplier+s that highlights the main sources of suppliersâ€™ CO2e emissions and provides guidance on how to reduce them. Once suppliers have completed the learning phase, they provide us with their primary data through the tool.
