The EU Taxonomyâ€™s catalog of economic activities includes business activities with the most potential for contributing to the six defined environmental objectives. If a business activ- ity does not fall within the scope of the EU Taxonomy, it does not give an indication that such businesses could not be sustainable. For the reporting year 2023, EU Taxonomy reporting is limited to the first two environmental objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation).

With expansion of the criteria on all six environmental objec- tives for fiscal 2024, we expect an increased EU Taxonomy coverage for our portfolio in the next year.
