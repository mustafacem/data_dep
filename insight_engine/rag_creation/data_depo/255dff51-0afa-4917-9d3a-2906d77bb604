Leases â€“ A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Further information on leases can be found in Notes 8, 13 and 16.

Lessor: Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases, determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred. If this is the case, the lease is classified as a finance lease; if not, it is an operating lease. Receivables from finance leases are recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The assets underlying the operating leases are presented in Property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives or to their estimated residual value. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
