With regards to the assessment of whether there are indications for a reversal of an impairment, in particular regarding the interpretation of a possible significant increase of the fair value, we evaluated management’s assessment made on a quarterly and year-end basis as well as management’s judgements and estimates contained therein and also considered external evidence on credit ratings, stock market prices, analysts' assessments and observable valuation indicatorsin this regard. In addition, we evaluated the calculation of the reversal of the impairment as of March 31, 2023.
