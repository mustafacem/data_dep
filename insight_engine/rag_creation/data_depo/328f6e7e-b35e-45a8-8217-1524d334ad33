The Siemens portfolio is simultaneously supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are doing this by focusing on automation and digitalization, smart infrastruc- ture for buildings with decentralized energy systems and charging solutions, and intelligent transportation solutions. For instance, our energy-efficient products and solutions can support the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, and our electrification solutions enable renewable grid integration and the electrification of heat and hydrogen. This also creates more business opportunities for Siemens.
