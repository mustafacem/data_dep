This aligned CapEx includes €116 million related to a CapEx plan, associated with building projects to be finalized by fiscal 2028, summing up to a planned total volume of €1.4 billion (capitalizable and non-capitalizable costs). The buildings are designed to minimize energy use and carbon emissions (CCM 7.7).

Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) related to Siemens’ real estate portfolio represents the largest portion in overall CapEx eligibility. The difference between Taxonomy- eligible CapEx and Taxonomy-aligned CapEx is impacted by (i) only partial availability of information on energy perfor- mance certificates for our global portfolio and (ii) energy certificates below the required threshold defined in the Substantial Contribution criteria for the energy efficiency of buildings.
