Siemens Healthineers is largely subject to the Group-wide principles for our ICS and ERM and is responsible for adhering to those principles.

The integration of Varian into our ICS, which began in fiscal 2021 after the acquisition by Siemens Healthineers, continued in fiscal 2023 and was completed to a very large extent with regard to all Varian entities. The integration measures are planned to be completely finalized in fiscal 2024.
