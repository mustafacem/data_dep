SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 49

3.4 Cybersecurity and data privacy

The Information Security Policies define the mandatory high- level requirements and general rules for information security. The policies serve as blueprints for establishing and managing information security at Siemens. The requirements are based on the domains defined in Annex A of the international standard ISO/IEC 27001. Siemens’ cybersecurity governance has been ISO 27001-certified since November 2017.

Our commitment to cybersecurity is further reinforced by Siemens’ participation in founding the “Charter of Trust”1 initiative to protect data and promote cybersecurity in a trustworthy digital world.
