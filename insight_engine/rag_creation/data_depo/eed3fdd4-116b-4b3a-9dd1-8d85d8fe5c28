Interest rate risk management

Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship

Interest rate risk management uses derivative financial instruments under a portfolio-based approach to manage interest risk actively. The approach does not qualify for hedge accounting. Gains and losses in connection with interest rate swap agreements are recorded in Other financial income (expenses), net. The interest rate risk management includes SFS business, for which the interest rate risk was formerly managed separately.
