Shortage of skilled personnel: Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel, such as specialists and experts in technical fields, remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate. We have ongoing demand for highly skilled people and a need to enhance diversity, inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce. Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to attract engineers, tech talent and other qualified personnel. We address these topics for example by strengthening the capabilities and skills of our talent acquisition teams and a strategy of proactive search for people with the required capabilities in our respective industries and markets. In fiscal 2023 we rolled out our new Employer Branding in all our recruiting marketing activities and started a media campaign with focus on tech talent in our key markets. Technology and digitalization help us to be more effective in attracting and selecting diverse talent. In addition, we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning. As with our existing people, we must also provide new talent with opportunities to grow and bond, especially soon after they join us. This appears especially relevant at a time of new, increasingly virtual working environments.
