Conserving resources

– Assessment of our biodiversity footprint as foundation for further improvements

– Accomplished energy reduction as part of our energy efficiency ambition

– Implementation of water strategy almost completed

Management approach As a company producing a diverse array of products, systems,

solutions, and services, and with office locations around the world, we strive to reduce the environmental impacts of our sites through the limited use of resources.

Energy is an important resource in production, and its usage reduction is a key strategy for decarbonization. While we aim to obtain all our electricity from renewable sources, we recognize that even the generation of renewable electricity, for example, through wind turbines or photovoltaics, can have negative impacts on the environment because these systems must be manufactured, they change the local landscape when in operation, and they must be disposed of at the end of their lifecycle.
