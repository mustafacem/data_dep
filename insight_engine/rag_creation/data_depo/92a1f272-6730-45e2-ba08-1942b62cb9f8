Other matter – use of the auditor’s report

Our auditor’s report must always be read together with the audited annual financial statements and the audited management report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The annual financial statements and the management report converted to the ESEF format – including the versions to be published in the Unternehmensregister [German Company Register] – are merely electronic renderings of the audited annual financial statements and the audited management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.
