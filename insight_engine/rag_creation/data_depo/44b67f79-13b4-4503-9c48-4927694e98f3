Foreign currency exchange rate risk

Transaction risk

Each Siemens unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of business, Siemens units are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.
