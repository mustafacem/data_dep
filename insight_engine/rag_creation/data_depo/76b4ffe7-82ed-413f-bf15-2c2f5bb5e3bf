Service cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately in profit or loss. For unfunded plans, the amount in line item Provisions for pensions and similar obligations equals the DBO. For funded plans, Siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets from the DBO. Siemens recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling.
