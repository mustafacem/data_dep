3.1 Compliance and ethics

3.1

Compliance and ethics

– Zerotolerance approach to breaches of applicable laws and our internal guidelines

– A global, riskbased compliance system – Ethics and integrity are the basis for sustainable

business practices

Management approach Operating with integrity and in compliance with laws and

regulation is fundamental to stakeholder trust and our com- pany’s continued success. Siemens and its roughly 320,000 employees operate in multiple countries around the world. Our customers in both the private and public sectors serve a vast array of industries. Our global business operations are governed by numerous national legal systems and take place in a variety of political, social, and cultural settings that are constantly changing. Therefore, Siemens’ business and compliance environment is correspondingly complex.
