Foreign currency exchange rate risk is quantified based on a sensitivity analysis. In order to quantify remaining market risks Siemens has implemented a system based on Value at Risk (VaR), which is also used for internal management of Corporate Treasury activities. The VaR figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of various risk factors, a ten day holding period, and a 99.5% confidence level.

Actual results that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income may differ substantially from VaR figures due to fundamental conceptual differences. While the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of a model with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss, which will not be exceeded within ten days with a probability of 99.5%. Although VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitations including the following. A ten day holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of the underlying positions within this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods of illiquid markets. A 99.5% confidence level means that there is a 0.5% statistical
