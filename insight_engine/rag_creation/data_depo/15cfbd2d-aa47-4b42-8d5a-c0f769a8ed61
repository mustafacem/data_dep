Siemens said it has completed its acquisition of Heliox.

The Netherlands-based company is an electric-vehicle charging specialist serving bus and truck fleets and passenger vehicles, Siemens said Thursday.

The company added the acquisition will extend Siemens's reach in Europe and North America and expand its e-mobility offerings.

The deal, which was announced in August last year, was cleared by the U.K.'s Competition and Market Authority in early December, after it launched an inquiry into the acquisition in October.
