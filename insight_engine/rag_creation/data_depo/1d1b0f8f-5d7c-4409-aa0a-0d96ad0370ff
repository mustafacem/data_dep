B.3.3 Malus and clawback regulations

Under existing malus and clawback regulations, the Supervisory Board is authorized to withhold or reclaim variable compensation in cases of severe breaches of duty or compliance and/or unethical behavior or in cases of grossly negligent or willful breaches of the duty of care or in cases in which variable compensation components linked to the achievement of specific targets have been unduly paid out on the basis of incorrect data.

The Supervisory Board exercises its authority to withhold or reclaim variable compensation components at its duty-bound discretion.
