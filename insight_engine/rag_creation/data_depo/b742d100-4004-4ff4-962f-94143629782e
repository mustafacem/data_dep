In addition, sustainability – as a strategic goal and an expression of Siemens’ social responsibility – is a high priority at Siemens. Sustainability is managed using the DEGREE framework. Introduced in fiscal 2021, this framework addresses sustainability from every angle and determines Siemens’ ambitions in the sustainability area with systematized, measurable and specific long-term targets for environment, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. DEGREE is an acronym that stands for decarbonization, ethics, governance, resource efficiency, equity and employability. The DEGREE framework is continuously developed and adapted to the commitments that Siemens has made, such as the Science Based Targets initiative. The key performance indicators applied in long-term variable compensation are part of this DEGREE framework (CO2 emissions and digital learning hours per employee) and/or reflect the Company’s priorities (Net Promoter Score as an expression of customer satisfaction).
