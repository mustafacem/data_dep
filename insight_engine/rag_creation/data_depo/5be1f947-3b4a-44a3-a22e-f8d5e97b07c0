Primary measure for managing and controlling profit and profitability at Group level: Net income is the primary driver of basic earnings per share from net income (EPS) as well as of EPS before purchase price allocation accounting (EPS pre PPA) which is used for our capital market communication. EPS pre PPA is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. As with EPS, EPS pre PPA includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG. We aim to achieve high-single-digit annual growth in EPS pre PPA over a cycle of three to five years.
