Compliance Officers in the business ensure that our Compli- ance system is implemented worldwide. They work closely with employees and managers, who assume personal responsibility for compliance in their respective business units.

We believe that it is necessary for the entire management team to act on our commitment to compliance and ensure that all business decisions and transactions that fall within their area of responsibility comply with both the relevant legal requirements and our own values and company guide- lines.
