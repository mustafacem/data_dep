The majority holding in SHS (75.4%) reflects the diversification benefits Siemens enjoys from the less cyclical and generally highly profitable health care operations. SHS is fully consolidated and is listed--a fungible stake could be monetized or used to fund acquisitions, like VMS, to protect credit metrics. Siemens' shareholding has a current value of about â‚¬46.5 billion.
