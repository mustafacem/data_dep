Siemens has a relatively high degree of diversification and large scale within the capital goods industry. Despite the significant disposals and spin-offs losing more than €30 billion of revenue since 2020, the group has maintained a large scale within the capital goods industry--generating revenues of close to €80 billion. This is thanks to its balanced, long-term focus on capital allocation, investing into research and development (R&D; 8% of revenues), growth capital expenditure (capex), and acquisitions.
