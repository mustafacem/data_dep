→ MyGrowth Career: This program allows our people to shape their own career development. It is integrated into a holistic concept and focuses on the individual’s career trajectory. Core components of MyGrowth Career include the open markets reflected in the Open Job Market and People Profile and other options like Job Tagging (show- ing interest in a particular department), Job Shadowing, and Mentoring to encourage personal growth.

Siemens Growth Talks are the connecting links between the elements mentioned above. All of our people receive regular performance reviews in the form of Siemens Growth Talks. These agile, ongoing, forward-looking, strength-based conversations support both individual and organizational growth, performance, and well-being. Support materials like discussion guidelines, questions for reflection, and workshop templates help our people, teams, and managers maintain an ongoing, respectful, and encouraging dialog on personal development and learning.
