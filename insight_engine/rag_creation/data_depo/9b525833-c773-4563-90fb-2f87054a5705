2.4 Liquidity and dividend

We intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. In the Siemens Financial Framework, we strive for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year, or at least matches it.

As in the past, we intend to fund the dividend payout from Free cash flow. Our primary measure to assess our ability to generate cash, and ultimately to pay dividends, is the cash conversion rate for the Siemens Group, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow (continuing and discontinued operations) to net income. Over a cycle of three to five years, we aim to achieve a cash conversion rate of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate.
