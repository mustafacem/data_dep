We prepare for and adapt well to changing circum- stances.

The principles guide the process of HS @ S in three steps: reality check, resilient health and safety management, and evaluation.

The reality check helps build a comprehensive understanding of the status of health and safety. It includes a survey that provides a snapshot of employee perception across various aspects in the categories “work climate,” “leadership,” “learn- ing,” and “processes and resources.” Results are reviewed and potential for improvement is identified. Based on the first rollout of the HS @ S, additional perspectives – including the perceptions of management in key functions and data- based expert views – were added to the reality check. Furthermore, in fiscal 2023, the management’s perceptions of our business challenges and their impacts on health and safety were added by interviews and specific local factors influencing health and safety were further analyzed.
