Combined Management Report

11. EU Taxonomy disclosure The key performance indicators (KPI) in this section were determined based on Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 in conjunction with the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable for the Consolidated Financial Statements. For calculating the eligibility and alignment KPIs, Siemensâ€™ business activities and associated revenue, capital expenditures (CapEx), and operating expenditures (OpEx) were predominantly directly mapped to an applicable economic activity listed in the Commission Delegated Acts in connection with EU regulation 2020/852. For the calculation of CapEx and OpEx, allocations were also made based on the revenue of the Taxonomy-eligible and aligned activities. To avoid double counting, a mapping was always made to one economic activity only. Following the eligibility assessment, the alignment with Substantial Contribution criteria for all eligible business activities was assessed and documented based on appropriate reporting hierarchy levels, such as business-segment, product-family or project level. Once a business activity demonstrated Substantial Contribution, the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria were assessed together with technical experts on the product, site, project and/or supplier level. For fiscal 2023, EU Taxonomy reporting is limited to the first two environmental objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaption). Based on its implemented group-wide structures on risk analysis, corporate guidelines and due diligence processes and mechanisms, Siemens fulfills the Minimum Safeguards requirements, which comprise the areas of human rights, anti-corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition.
