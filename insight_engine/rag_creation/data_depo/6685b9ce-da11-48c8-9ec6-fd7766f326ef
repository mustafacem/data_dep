Progress on DEGREE ambition #7: Natural resource decoupling through increased purchase of secondary materials for metals and resins

We want to increase the procurement of secondary materials for metals and resins and implement a circular economy. In fiscal 2023, we purchased 35% of the metals – primarily iron, copper and aluminum used in the manufacture of our products – from recycled sources. This percentage is the weighted average of the secondary material proportions of the three metals based on average regional or global values from literature values and supplier informa- tion. Last year this share was 34%. Moreover, in fiscal 2023 we sourced < 1% of the resins used to make our products from recycled sources. We continue to work with the recycling chains for technical plastics currently being established, and on further developing product specifications as well as material standards in this context.
