- We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be 17.5%-18.5% over fiscals 2024 and 2025, compared with 17.3% in fiscal 2023. In our view, this is mainly because of the normalization of inflationary environment even though the company is prone to the weaker macroeconomic environment, combined with the increase in R&D expenses caused by the company's focus on software and digital technologies. The tighter margins are offset by modest volume improvements, margin expansion in DI and SHS, and the effect of various cost-cutting measures. Profits are also likely to benefit from a gradual reduction in other corporate costs.
