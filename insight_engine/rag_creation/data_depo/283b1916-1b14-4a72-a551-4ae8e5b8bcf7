Environmental clean-up costs relate to remediation and environmental protection liabilities which have been accrued based on the estimated costs of decommissioning the site for the production of uranium and mixed-oxide fuel elements in Hanau, Germany (Hanau facilities), as well as for a nuclear research and service center in Karlstein, Germany (Karlstein facilities). In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a contract under public-law, based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of €360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to measure the obligations that remain with Siemens AG, regarding conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility “Schacht Konrad” or a logistics depot until year-end 2032. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the provisions total €480 million and €487 million, respectively.
