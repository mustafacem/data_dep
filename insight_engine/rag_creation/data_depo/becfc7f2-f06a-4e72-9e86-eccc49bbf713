Operating expenditures KPI

The OpEx KPI shows the ratio of OpEx from Taxonomy-eligible and/or aligned economic activities to total OpEx. The total OpEx comprises direct non-capitalized costs related to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repairs, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant, and equipment per Annex I of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. Accordingly, 12.4% (€0.9 billion) of Siemens’ OpEx were eligible and 8.2% (€0.6 billion) were aligned.
