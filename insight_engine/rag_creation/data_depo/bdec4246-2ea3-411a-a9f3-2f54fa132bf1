Our purchasing activities have impacts on our suppliers, local communities, and the environment in our procurement markets. As such, we monitor and engage with our suppliers to drive and support their efforts to enhance sustainability practices. Our supplier relationships provide us with the opportunity to make contributions to securing jobs and promoting adherence to both international work and envi- ronmental standards. Using our holistic sustainable supply chain management approach, we work to prevent situations where suppliers may be tempted to compromise the well- being of their workforce or violate environmental regulations.
