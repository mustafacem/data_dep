B.5 Pension benefit commitment

Most of the members of the Managing Board are included in the Siemens Defined Contribution Pension Plan (BSAV). Since fiscal 2020, newly appointed members of the Managing Board can be awarded, instead of BSAV contributions, a fixed cash amount for free disposal.

Contributions under the BSAV are credited to the individual members’ pension accounts in the January following each fiscal year. Until pension payments begin, members’ pension accounts are credited with an annual interest payment (guaranteed interest) on January 1 of each year. The interest rate is currently 0.25%.
