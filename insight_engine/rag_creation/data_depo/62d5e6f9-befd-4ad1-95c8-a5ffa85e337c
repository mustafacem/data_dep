5.5 Corporate citizenship

The promotion of education can take different forms and pursue different objectives: However, the primary objective remains consistent. We aim to provide enhanced equal access to future opportunities, and to give young people the tools to master future challenges.

Coding skills are increasingly relevant to helping people and organizations overcome the challenges of digitalization. As such, Siemens supports a diverse range of programming- oriented learning programs and projects designed for children. These include UBBU in Portugal, Hacker School in Germany, and Project Jigyaasa in India. Many of these pro- grams are supported by volunteers from Siemens staff.
