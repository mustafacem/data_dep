Environmental, Social, And Governance

Governance factors are a positive consideration in our credit rating analysis of Siemens. This is because the company adheres to the highest standard of disclosure, and management is committed to long-term, sustainable organic growth. We also view positively the group's forward-looking strategic planning processes and ability to execute on its strategy.

Environmental and social factors are an overall neutral consideration in our credit rating analysis. That said, Siemens is likely to benefit from the current sustainability trends through its smart infrastructure segment, providing energy saving infrastructure and services for buildings, and through its mobility segment, benefiting from government investments into less carbon-intense railway transportation infrastructure, and from its software offering (digital twin) to design energy-efficient production lines and products.
