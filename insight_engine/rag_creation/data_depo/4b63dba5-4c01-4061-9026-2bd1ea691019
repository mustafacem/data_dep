Smart Infrastructure’s principal competitors consist mainly of large multinational companies and smaller manufacturers in emerging countries. Its solutions and services business also competes with local players such as system integrators and facility management firms. Smart Infrastructure’s businesses are impacted by changes in the overall economic environment to varying degrees, depending on the customer segment and offering. Demand for Smart Infrastructure’s electrical and building products offerings is driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles, while demand for its systems and solutions offerings changes more slowly, with a time lag of several quarters. In contrast, demand for service offerings shows only limited influence from macroeconomic cycles. Overall, Smart Infrastructure has developed a balanced and resilient business mix with its diversified regional and vertical markets; its range of products, systems, solutions and services; and its participation in both long- and short-cycle markets. To further strengthen the resilience of its portfolio, Smart Infrastructure aims to increase the share of overall revenue that comes from services.
