Capital structure

We aim in general for a capital structure of up to 1.5; we expect to achieve this in fiscal 2024.

Cash conversion rate

For fiscal 2024, we expect a cash conversion rate that contributes to reaching our target of 1 minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate of Siemens over a cycle of three to five years.
