Siemens takes a risk-based approach to identifying potential risks in its supply chain. This includes Corporate Responsibility Self-Assessments (CRSAs) by suppliers and external sustain- ability audits. When deviations from the Supplier Code of Conduct and violations of the human rights principles are identified, we work with suppliers to clarify how lasting corrective actions can be taken within a reasonable time- frame.
