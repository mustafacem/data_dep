While the U.S. showed stronger economic growth than expected, the European Union (E.U.) experienced the difficulties that were widely expected. The drastic increase of energy prices in calendar 2022, a result of the war in Ukraine, had a severe negative impact, especially on energy-intensive industries. Strong increases in inflation rates led the European Central bank to increase the main policy interest rate to 4.5% which weighed on fixed investment, especially in the real estate sector. Moreover, the global manufacturing and trade slowdown mentioned above weighed on the E.U., due in particular to the high concentration of manufacturing and export industries in Germany, the regionâ€™s largest economy. GDP growth in calendar 2023 is expected to be 0.4% in the E.U. and -0.4% in Germany. Only the service sector, in particular tourism, supported the overall E.U. economy.
