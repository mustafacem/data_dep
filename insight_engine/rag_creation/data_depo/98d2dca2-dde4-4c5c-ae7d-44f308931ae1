Our German prototype program “Trans* at work” supports our people with collegial counselling before, during, and after transition.1 Following its success, we developed rele- vant program guidelines for our people and managers. In addition, we were able to work with our people to identify Trans Advocates who could serve as a first point of contact for any inquiries about the program.1

Siemens also released a global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Learning Channel to raise awareness of the importance of a more equitable and inclusive workplace and to recognize and address any potential biases or discriminatory practices.1
