Research Update: Siemens AG Upgraded To &#39;AA-&#39; On Successful Portfolio Transformation And Conservative Financial Policy; Outlook Stable

Outlook

The stable outlook reflects our view that Siemens'; operating performance will continue to improve over the next 24 months, on the back of healthy secular demand in its end markets, despite some challenges in the wider economy. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to remain between 17%-19% over the next 24 months, while maintaining strong credit metrics with funds from operations (FFO) to debt well above 45%. We anticipate Siemens will continue to maintain comfortable headroom under our rating threshold during normal operating circumstances, as well as to balance shareholder remuneration and acquisitions, in line with its conservative financial policy.
