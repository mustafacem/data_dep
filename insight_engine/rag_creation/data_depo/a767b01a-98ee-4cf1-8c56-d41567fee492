The mandatory environmental management system for our sites includes the requirement to establish targets and measures for reducing air pollutants, and where applicable, to address and mitigate their impact.

Our Environmental Protection Standards include a commit- ment to phase out ODSs. In fiscal 2023, we held VOC and ODS training workshops to increase awareness of the harmful effects of air pollutants, improve the data quality at sites, and provide recommendations for the reduction and phase- out of VOCs and ODSs.
