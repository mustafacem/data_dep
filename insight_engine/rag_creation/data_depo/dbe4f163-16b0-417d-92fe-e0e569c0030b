improvement of efficiency in primary & secondary energy use compared to 2021

When looking at Siemens’ total energy consumption, we differentiate between primary and secondary energy. Our primary energy consumption declined 16.5% in fiscal 2023. Our consumption of natural gas and liquid petroleum gas declined 22.2% compared to the previous fiscal year. With continuing gas shortages, this was a special focus for Siemens in fiscal 2023. To determine energy consumption by our company vehicles, we calculated the consumption of all cars used by employees and for services and our trucks. In fiscal 2023, the company fleet consumed about 2,894 thou- sand gigajoules of fuel, which is a 1% decrease from the previous fiscal year.
