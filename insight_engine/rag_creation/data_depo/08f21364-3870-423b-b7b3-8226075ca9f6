Share Matching Program and its underlying plans

In fiscal 2023, Siemens issued a new tranche under each of the plans of the Share Matching Program.

Share Matching Plan

Under the Share Matching Plan, senior managers may invest a specified part of their variable compensation in Siemens shares (investment shares). The shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date in the second quarter. Plan participants receive the right to one Siemens share without payment of consideration (matching share) for every three investment shares continuously held over a period of about three years (vesting period) provided the plan participant has been continuously employed by Siemens until the end of the vesting period.
