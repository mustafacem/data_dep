Risk management at Siemens builds on a comprehensive, interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM approach is based on the globally accepted COSO Standard (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) Enterprise Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process, our internal control and our compliance management system. They consider a company’s strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.
