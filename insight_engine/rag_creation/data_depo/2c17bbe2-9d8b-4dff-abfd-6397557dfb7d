Risk management at Siemens builds on a comprehensive, interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk Man- agement (ERM) approach that is integrated into the organi- zation and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, opera- tional, financial, and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective measures and controls. A detailed description of our enterprise risk management basic principles and process can be found in our combined management report, chapter 8.2 Risk management.
