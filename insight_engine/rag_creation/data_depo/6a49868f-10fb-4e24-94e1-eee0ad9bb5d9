In our Carbon Reduction@Suppliers program, we collaborate with an external partner to analyze the economic data and model the carbon footprint of each of our suppliers. To facilitate this process, we utilize a web-based tool called supplier+s that highlights the main sources of suppliersâ€™ CO2e emissions and provides guidance on how to reduce them. Once suppliers have completed the learning phase, they provide us with their primary data through the tool. CONSERVING RESOURCES, SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES
