Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. In order to manage the Companyâ€™s position with regard to interest rate risk, interest income and interest expenses, Corporate Treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. The interest rate risk is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated Asset Liability Management approach and results primarily from funding in the U.S. dollar, British pound and euro. This includes SFS business, for which the interest rate risk was formerly managed separately.
