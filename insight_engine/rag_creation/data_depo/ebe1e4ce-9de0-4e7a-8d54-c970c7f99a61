Emission of air pollutants We take a comprehensive approach to air pollution by analyzing

local emissions at our various office and production facilities around the world. We also pay close attention to emissions from volatile organic compounds (VOC), pollutants from combustion processes, and where they are still present, ozone-depleting substances (ODS) at our environmentally relevant sites. Based on our internal environmental standards, these principles and procedures are implemented on a man- datory basis.
