Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the annual financial statements and the management report

Management is responsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations, and that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German legally required accounting principles. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as it, in accordance with German legally required accounting principles, has determined necessary to enable the preparation of annual financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.
