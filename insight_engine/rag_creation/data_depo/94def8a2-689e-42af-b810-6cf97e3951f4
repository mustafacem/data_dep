Training and stakeholder involvement in product stewardship We actively

involve our customers in our Ecodesign approaches. Our business units reach out to customers to discover their specific requirements for Ecodesign measures and to get feedback on measures already implemented. Regular workshops with selected customers like wholesalers are conducted to poll their opinions on required or performed Ecodesign measures.

Since fiscal 2022, the two-part Circular Design learning pro- gram has been available online to all Siemens employees. In addition, we developed the Leading in Sustainability as part of the Top Management Leadership Program, a learning program for our leaders with also a focus on the circular economy. We maintain internal stakeholder engagement and raise awareness with measures like environmental protection newsletters and environmental information campaigns.
