In its global business, Siemens does part of its business with state-owned enterprises and governments. We also participate in projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations, such as multilateral development banks. Ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption, antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts. Such investigations may also adversely affect existing private business relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic projects and transactions, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures or other business alliances, or could result in the cancellation of certain of our existing contracts. Moreover, third parties, including our competitors, could initiate significant litigation.
