SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 46

Self-assessments and site audits as control mechanisms Based on the risk categories, we conduct appropriate evalu-

ations of suppliers in accordance with our risk assessment. These reviews range from supplier self-assessments of their own sustainability practices to on-site sustainability audits conducted by external auditors.

Corporate Responsibility SelfAssessments CRSAs are an integral part of our supplier qualification pro-

cess. They are subject to regular review and updates to align them with evolving standards and regulations. As part of this process, potential suppliers undergo a mandatory qualifica- tion procedure, while existing suppliers are re-assessed every three years.
