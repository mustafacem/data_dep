At the end of each fiscal year, our management performs an evaluation of the effectiveness of the accounting-related ICS. We have a standardized procedure under which necessary controls are defined, documented in accordance with uniform standards, and tested regularly for their effectiveness. Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any control system, and no system, including one determined to be effective, may prevent or detect all misstatements.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements according to IFRS are prepared on the basis of a centrally issued conceptual framework which primarily consists of uniform Financial Reporting Guidelines and a chart of accounts. For Siemens AG and other companies within the Siemens Group required to prepare financial statements in accordance with German Commercial Code, this conceptual framework is complemented by mandatory regulations specific to the German Commercial Code. The need for adjustments in the conceptual framework due to regulatory changes is analyzed on an ongoing basis. Accounting departments are informed quarterly about current topics and deadlines from an accounting and closing process perspective.
