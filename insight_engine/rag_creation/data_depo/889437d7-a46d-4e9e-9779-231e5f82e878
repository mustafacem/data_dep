4.4 EU taxonomy

The EU Taxonomyâ€™s current eligibility rules for reporting on climate change mitigation and adaption cover the Digital Industries portfolio to a limited extent only. With the appli- cation of the four new environmental objectives for fiscal 2024 and amendments to existing objectives, an increased coverage of business activities is expected.

The Smart Infrastructure (SI) portfolio includes a wide range of products, services, solutions, and software for all aspects of grid management, electrical products, building automation, fire protection and security, e-mobility charging infrastructure, and energy efficiency. It offers smart connections for energy systems, buildings, and industries.
