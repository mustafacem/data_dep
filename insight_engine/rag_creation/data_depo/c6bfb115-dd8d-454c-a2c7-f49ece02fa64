DEGREE targets

As part of our DEGREE sustainability framework (without Siemens Healthineers), we set a goal for all Siemens production facilities and buildings worldwide and our vehicle fleet to achieve a Net Zero carbon footprint by 2030. In effect, this means reducing Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions in Siemens’ business operations for Siemens without Siemens Healthineers (SHS) by 90% by 2030, compared to 2019. To achieve this target, Siemens has pledged to invest an additional €650 million in its own decarbonization efforts by 2030. Any residual emissions will then be balanced with high-quality carbon offsets that meet established standards.
