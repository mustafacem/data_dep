Berlin and Munich, December 6, 2023

Dear Shareholders,

In fiscal 2023, Siemens AG once again demonstrated its operational excellence as a leading technology company by delivering an impressively high level of profitable growth. The Company’s long-range strategy of combining the real and the digital worlds and its rigorous orien- tation toward long-term growth fields paid off: Siemens benefited from strong, stable developments in the global markets – above all, from worldwide efforts to make value chains across the board more efficient, resilient and sustainable. The Company also made major invest- ments to drive its innovative power and enhance its manufacturing capacities – while further strengthening its regional diversification.
