AI also boosts the effectiveness of our cybersecurity proce- dures by automating day-to-day tasks. This automation enables our security teams to concentrate on more intricate and pressing issues.

Despite the advantages, it is important to note that AI can also be used as a tool of cyber attackers by enhancing the complexity of their malicious actions. The attackers might harness AI to automate their attacks, evade conventional security systems, or even simulate human behavior to escape detection.
