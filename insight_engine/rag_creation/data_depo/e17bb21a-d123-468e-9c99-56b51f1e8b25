Orders rose 7% year-over-year to €92.3 billion, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.19, thus fulfilling our expectation of a ratio above 1. Order growth was driven by sharply higher volume from large orders at Mobility, including an order worth €2.9 billion for locomotives and associated maintenance in India and a €2.5 billion order for the first line of a turnkey rail system in Egypt, and by clear growth in Smart Infrastructure led by the electrification business. Orders in Digital Industries came in lower as the destocking trend mentioned above had a significant effect on its automation businesses.
