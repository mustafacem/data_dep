Dugan, Keryn Lee James, Martina Merz, Benoît Potier, Kasper Rørsted, Dr. Nathalie von Siemens, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Grazia Vittadini and Matthias Zachert – and thus an appropriate number of members who are independent within the meaning of the Code. The regulations establishing limits on age and restricting membership in the Supervisory Board to three full terms of office are complied with.
