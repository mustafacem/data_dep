NOTE 17 Post-employment benefits

Defined benefit plans

The defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by the Company. Only to a certain extent, those plans are affected by longevity, inflation and compensation increases and take country specific differences into account. The Companyâ€™s major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities. In accordance with local laws these plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries by way of contractual trust agreements with each separate legal entity. The defined benefit plans cover 442,000 participants, including 183,000 actives, 82,000 deferreds with vested benefits and 177,000 retirees and surviving dependents.
