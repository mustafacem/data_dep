SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 53

Assessing and fostering our privacy by design processes was a key focus area in fiscal 2023. Privacy by design at Siemens is supported by our Privacy by Design Toolkit, a software solution that helps process owners incorporate data privacy in all the stages of product development. One of the Toolkit modules includes data privacy questions that must be answered before the launch of a planned product or service. The toolkit is intended to integrate data privacy from the very beginning of a productâ€™s development. We also rolled out a new privacy by design awareness training program for product developers in a virtual classroom, learn about and discuss data privacy challenges drawn from real business examples. As part of our global audit plan, selected Siemens products were also included in our data privacy audits.
