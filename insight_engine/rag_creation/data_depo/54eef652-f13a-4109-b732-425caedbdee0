Profit at Siemens's digital industries business fell 20% in the quarter as short-cycle automation demand normalized and customers continued destocking, Chief Executive Roland Busch said in a post-earnings call to media.

However, demand has improved sequentially, he said. "We expect this trend to continue in the quarters ahead," Busch said.

That said, customer destocking in China might extend into the second half of fiscal 2024, Chief Financial Officer Ralf P. Thomas said in the same post-earnings call.
