SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 82

Talent markets continue to be highly dynamic and com- petitive. It is becoming harder to win and bond the highly sought-after talents that are key to driving the Siemens transformation. Candidates are clear about their expecta- tions of an attractive employer:

(a) empowerment and personal choice

(b) skill development

(c) a sense of belonging and contributing to a larger purpose.

Growing our people is a vital answer in tight talent markets. Gaining the trust of our people and bonding with them builds a competitive advantage that is regularly measured and reflected in our Siemens Global Engagement Survey (SGES)2.
