The regular review of Managing Board compensation at the beginning of fiscal 2023 in order to determine the compensation’s appropriateness and conformity with customary market practices indicated that – when compared to the companies in the DAX 40, the German blue-chip stock index, that have been defined in the compensation system as the relevant market – the total target compensation of the members of the Managing Board of Siemens AG was positioned toward the lower end of the customary market ranges. Compared to the companies in the STOXX Europe 50, which is also used for a market comparison due to Siemens’ international footprint, direct target compensation was actually below the customary market range. Against this backdrop, the Supervisory Board approved an increase in the total target compensation of all Managing Board members as of October 1, 2022. This increase was implemented by raising the individual members’ Stock Awards target amounts. The Stock Awards target amount for Dr. Roland Busch was raised to €3,340,000 from €2,954,000, the target amount for Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas was raised to €2,145,000 from €2,000,000, the target amount for Cedrik Neike was raised to €1,470,000 from €1,259,000, and the target amounts for the remaining Managing Board members were raised to €1,380,000 from €1,259,000.
