According to the Company policy, Siemens units are responsible for recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by 100% with Corporate Treasury. Foreign currency transaction exposure of the Siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with Corporate Treasury within a band of 75% to 100% for a hedging period of at least three months.
