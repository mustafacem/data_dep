With regard to capital expenditures, we expect a significant increase in fiscal 2024. In the context of the €2 billion investment strategy presented in fiscal 2023 to strengthen growth, innovation and resilience, significant amounts will be invested in the coming years for the construction and expansion of high-tech production facilities in the U.S., China and Singapore. As part of this investment strategy, Siemens also announced the establishment of its new Technology Campus in Erlangen, Germany, to expand development and manufacturing capacities. In addition, up to €0.6 billion are to be invested in Siemensstadt Square. This project, initiated in fiscal 2019, aims to transform Siemens’ existing industrial area in Berlin into a modern urban district supporting a diverse range of purposes, including strengthening key technologies. Further investments are planned in relation to new office buildings, including Siemens Campus Erlangen. Furthermore, we continue to invest in attractive innovation fields through Next47, our global venture capital unit.
