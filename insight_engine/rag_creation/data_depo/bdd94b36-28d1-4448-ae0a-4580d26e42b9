Actions and results Our program Eco Efficiency @ Siemens has defined special

environmental protection priorities in the categories Robust Eco Design and Clean Supply Chain.

Robust Eco Design for future-fit product families RED focuses on the systematic application of Eco design to all lifecycle phases. The aim is to identify strategies that make a productâ€™s life as environmentally compatible as possible and that allow all materials to be recycled. At the same time, material and energy flows and losses will be reduced to the necessary minimum.
