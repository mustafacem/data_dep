Health and safety committees that meet regularly have been established in the relevant country organizations and on the local level. Here, management and employee representatives jointly coordinate the specific measures and initiatives needed for a healthy and safe work environment.

Based on our Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs), we have established internal monitoring systems and a company- wide risk management and control process.

We anchor our actions in Siemensâ€™ EHS Principles, which embed our EHS policy. They also include an obligation for all operating units to demonstrate a management system certi- fiable to ISO 45001. The effectiveness of these management systems is subject to an annual internal review that checks, among other things, whether processes for risk assessments and emergency management are implemented in accor- dance with internal and external regulations, that inspec- tions and reviews have been carried out, significant risks and opportunities have been identified and whether they are reflected in measurable goals and measures. The manage- ment system is also externally certified according to market requirements in the respective operating units.
