Progress on DEGREE ambition #2: Net Zero supply chain by 2050, 20% emissions reduction by 2030

In fiscal 2023, supply chain emissions decreased by 1% compared to the baseline year 2020, reaching 8,029 kt CO2e, with the carbon reduction measures implemented by our suppliers being reflected in this number. If the increase in purchasing volume of around 33% is included, CO2e emissions were however reduced even further in relation to the purchasing volume.

Progress  FY 20: 8,098 kt CO2e  – 1%  – 20% by 2030  – 100% by 2050  Siemens without SHS
