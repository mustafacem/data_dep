The early detection of environmental and social risks plays a key role in human rights due diligence.

We are strengthening our governance with regards to envi- ronmental, social, and human rights due diligence in customer-related business through targeted capacity-building, continuous due diligence tool-related enhancements (in our ESG Risk Due Diligence Tool, the ESG Radar), expanding relevant risk indicators for risk oversight creation, embedding environmental and social risk considerations in the company’s risk management processes, and strengthening risk mitigation pathways with the support of external human rights expertise. We are also enhancing our control mechanisms with a primary focus on our business sales department and contin- uously reassessing material areas of adverse impacts – for example, those resulting from certain business fields – so that they can be embedded in our due diligence systems.
