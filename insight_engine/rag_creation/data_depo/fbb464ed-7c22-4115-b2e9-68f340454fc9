Provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: We consider the accounting for provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations, including allegations of corruption and antitrust violations to be a key audit matter. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and, accordingly, on assets, liabilities and financial performance. The proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly, considerable management judgment, in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.
