As part of our substantive audit procedures, which particularly involved project reviews, we evaluated managementâ€™s estimates and assumptions based on a risk-based selection of a sample of contracts. Our sample primarily included projects that are subject to significant future uncertainties and risks, such as projects with complex safety/technical and regulatory requirements or projects with a large portion of materials and services to be provided by suppliers or consortium partners, fixed-price or turnkey projects, cross-border projects and projects with changes in cost estimates, delays and/or low or negative margins.
