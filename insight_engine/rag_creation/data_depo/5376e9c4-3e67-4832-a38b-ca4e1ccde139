If we are not successful in adapting our production and cost structure to subsequent changes in conditions in the markets in which we operate, there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects. For example, our customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products, solutions and services, or fail to follow through on purchases or contracts already executed. In addition, it may become more difficult for our customers to obtain financing. Contracted payment terms, especially regarding the level of advance payments by our customers relating to long-term projects, may become less favorable, which could negatively impact our financial condition. Siemensâ€™ global setup with operations in almost all relevant economies, our wide range of offerings with varied exposures to business cycles, and our balanced mix of business models (e.g. equipment, components, systems, software, services and solutions) help us to absorb impacts from adverse developments in any single market.
