Mobility sells its products, systems and solutions through its worldwide network of sales and execution units. The principal customers of Mobility are public and state-owned companies in the transportation and logistics sectors, so its markets are driven primarily by public spending. Customers usually have multi-year planning and implementation horizons, and their contract tenders therefore tend to be independent of short-term economic trends. Large contracts in the rolling stock and the rail infrastructure business are often awarded together with service contracts, which start to generate revenue only after the respective products and solutions have been put in operation, which can be a number of years after the contract award. Mobility’s principal competitors are multinational companies. Consolidation among Mobility’s competitors is continuing and may lead to increased competitive pressure within the rail transport industry and also to fewer sourcing options for rail customers.
