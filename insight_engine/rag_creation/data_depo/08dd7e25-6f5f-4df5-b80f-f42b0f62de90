Focus in fiscal 2023 As a critical precondition for implementing our RED

approach, we worked on developing automated solutions to calculate LCAs and generate EPDs in fiscal 2023. This aims to facilitate Ecodesign comparisons and the systematic use of LCAs and EPDs at Siemens. We also published an INTERNAL ON ECODESIGN to ensure alignment, increase transparency, and accelerate knowledge generation on Ecodesign.
