Expected tax effects, arising from prospectively applying the global minimum taxation rules (Pillar Two), are not considered in calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities. Currently, it is expected to apply Pillar Two to the entire Siemens Group commencing with fiscal 2025.

Contract assets, contract liabilities, receivables – When either party to a contract with customers has performed, Siemens presents a contract asset, a contract liability or a receivable depending on the relationship between Siemens’ performance and the customer’s payment. Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.
