Management approach At Siemens, we transform the everyday, for everyone â€“ for

our customers, our people, and society at large. This also means committing to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Siemens Healthineers has its own Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) organization to manage and orchestrate ambitions and activities.

We strive to create a work environment where our people are empowered and feel a sense of belonging. We believe that diversity positively impacts our teams and workplace and leads to more creative and innovative solutions. At Siemens, diversity means the inclusion and interaction of different ways of thinking, backgrounds, experiences, skills, and indi- vidual qualities across all levels and dimensions of the com- pany. Equity is an essential part of our corporate culture. Inclusion enables every voice to be heard and every individual to get involved.
