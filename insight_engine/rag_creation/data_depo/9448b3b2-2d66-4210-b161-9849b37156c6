Reporting principles for Customer Avoided Emissions

For 15 years (until fiscal 2021), we reported the revenue generated from our Environmental Portfolio and the result- ing annual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) achieved by our customers on the basis of the internal regu- lations defined in our Environmental Portfolio Guideline. Starting in fiscal 2022, we began to report key figures for sustainable activities, including revenue, in accordance with the new EU Taxonomy regulation. We are also continuing to calculate and report on Customer Avoided Emissions.
