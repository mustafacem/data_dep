8.2.1 Basic principles of risk management

Our risk management policy stems from a philosophy of pursuing sustainable growth and creating economic value while managing appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks. As risk management is an integral part of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our risk management policy is set by the Managing Board. Our organizational and accountability structure requires each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement risk management programs that are tailored to their specific industries and responsibilities, while being consistent with the overall policy.
