SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 134

DECENT WORK AND, ECONOMIC GROWTH ai

Goal 8 â€“ Promote sustained, inclusive and sus- tainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all

Siemens is committed globally to the New Normal Working Model. Our aim with the new normal is for all our people around the world to be able to work on a mobile basis two to three days a week, wherever feasible and reasonable. Mobile working has many advantages for the individual and also for the company: for instance, by ensuring that we are prepared to respond flexibly during future crises. Our worldwide business operations and our position as a thought leader mean that in many countries we contribute toward the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP). We are committed to offering attractive jobs and facilitating employment, and we are encouraging the decoupling of economic growth from energy consumption.
