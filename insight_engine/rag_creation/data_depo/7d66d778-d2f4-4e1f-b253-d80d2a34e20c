In addition, our Vilocify Vulnerability Services4 continually search for information about vulnerabilities in software and hardware components used in Siemensâ€™ products and infra- structures. As a final step, product security must be guaranteed by means of verification tests. To this end, we have developed the Siemens Extensible Security Testing Application (SiESTA5), which enables the dedicated identification of vulnerabilities in infrastructures, products, and solutions.
