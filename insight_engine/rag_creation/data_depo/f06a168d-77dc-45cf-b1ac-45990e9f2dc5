Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). They are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.

Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation increases, rate of pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based on government bonds yields. Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments.
