Valuation of non-current financial assets

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The impairment test and the assessment regarding the need for a reversal of impairment of non-current financial assets was a key audit matter, as in particular shares in affiliated companies and investments entail a higher risk of material misstatement due to the materiality of these assets as well as the estimation uncertainties and judgments involved in assessing whether there is objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment or a reversal of impairment, and the determination of the fair values.
