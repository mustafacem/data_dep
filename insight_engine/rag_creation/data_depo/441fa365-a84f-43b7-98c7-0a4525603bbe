In addition to CCR, “comparable revenue growth” was defined as the second individual target for fiscal 2023 for all members of the Managing Board. It indicates the development in Siemens’ business net of currency translation effects arising from the external environment outside of Siemens’ control and the portfolio effects that involve business activities that are either new to or no longer a part of the relevant business. For the President and CEO and the members of the Managing Board with primarily functional responsibility, the growth target was determined on the basis of continuing operations (c/o) related to the Siemens Group (Siemens c/o). For the Managing Board members with business responsibility for Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure, growth targets are based on their respective businesses. The respective target values were derived from the external outlook for fiscal 2023.
