Potential transition risks (e.g., regulation, market, and tech- nology) and physical climate-related risks are assessed in our risk process. In this process, we have generally identified the risk of an increasing sustainability focus. Governments around the world continue to increase their focus on sustain- ability topics, resulting in the risk of increased costs to comply with new laws and related reporting requirements. In addition, increasing stakeholder and investor focus on sustainability topics brings reputational risk should our sus- tainability commitments, targets and activities be perceived as a deceptive use of green marketing or otherwise not credible. Climate change litigation has become a worldwide phenomenon with a corresponding risk to Siemens as a large corporation. We address these risks in a variety of ways including through our sustainability framework DEGREE, in which we have set ambitious sustainability targets. DEGREE includes measures to reduce our carbon footprint along with other initiatives addressing ESG topics more generally. We have implemented an ESG due diligence process that supports Siemens businesses with due diligence in the customer- oriented environment with a view to possible environmental and social risks as well as related human rights and reputational risks. Finally, we believe our overall portfolio is very well positioned to meet the current and future sustainability needs of our customers and the societies in which we operate.
