Implementation rate of our RED approach In line with our DEGREE ambition, we consistently monitor

our progress with implementing the Siemens RED approach across the relevant product families in our business units, excluding Siemens Healthineers (SHS), and supporting busi- nesses such as Real Estate.

To do this, we classify products, systems, solutions, and ser- vices into groups that share similar technical characteristics, and we evaluate them based on RED criteria. The rate of implementation of the individual RED phases is then assessed in each of the relevant product families. If a criterion in a RED phase has been met, all the revenue generated by the product is considered RED-conformant. If a criterion is only partially met, 25% of the revenue is considered RED-conformant. If a criterion is not met, the corresponding revenue is disregarded.
