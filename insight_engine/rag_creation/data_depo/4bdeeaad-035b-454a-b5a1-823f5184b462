Our mandated purchasing units take general responsibility for implementing and complying with Siemensâ€™ procurement principles. Therefore, only mandated purchasing units are authorized to conclude contracts with suppliers.

We have developed policies that describe our standards for suppliers in terms of their social, environmental, and ethical performance. They lay the foundation for guiding supplier selection, evaluation, and ongoing engagement.

The Siemens Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Third-Party Intermediaries (Supplier Code of Conduct) is designed to cover our sustainability requirements. Among other princi- ples, it is based on the principles outlined in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and our Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs), which sets out the basic principles of sustainability for our suppliers.
