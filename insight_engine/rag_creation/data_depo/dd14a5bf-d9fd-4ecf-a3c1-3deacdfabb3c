• the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the group management report does not cover chapter 11 “EU Taxonomy disclosure” of the group management report, the sections “8.5.1 Internal Control System (ICS) and ERM” and “8.5.2 Compliance Management System (CMS)” in chapter 8.5 of the group management report and the content of the Corporate Governance Statement.
