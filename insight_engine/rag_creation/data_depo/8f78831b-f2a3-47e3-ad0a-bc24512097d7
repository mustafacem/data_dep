How did Siemens perform in fiscal 2023?

Fiscal 2023 was another very successful year for Siemens. We achieved excellent financial results in a volatile market environment, which on the one hand included destocking by customers and distributors following previously proactive purchasing, particularly in our short-cycle businesses, and on the other hand included improved supply chain conditions, which accelerated revenue conversion from our high order backlog. We raised our outlook during the fiscal year after the first and the second quarters. We then reached or exceeded all the targets set for our primary measures for fiscal 2023.
