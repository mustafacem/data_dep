Environment: Decarbonization, Resource efficiency As part of DEGREE, we have set high ambitions to signifi- cantly reduce CO2e emissions in Siemensâ€™ operations and upstream supply chain. Our approach to resource efficiency

accelerates recycling and promotes a more circular business. Our software and simulations reduce the use of substances of concern and other resource usage and introduce recycled materials as early as the design and simulation phases of our products, factories, and solutions. In addition, we promote the decoupling of natural resource consumption from eco- nomic growth by increasing the amount of secondary materials that we purchase.
