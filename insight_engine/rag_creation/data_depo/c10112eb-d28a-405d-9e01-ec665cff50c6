Continuous expansion of health services We are continuously expanding our spectrum of health ser-

vices to support the resilience and health of our people at work and beyond. In fiscal 2023, 99%1 of our employees have access to company medical care. This includes the prevention and early identification of health problems through health checks, screenings, and vaccinations. We treat health issues seriously and in a timely manner, which includes leveraging telemedicine consultations or referrals to experts. In addition, we facilitate a successful return to work by supporting our employees with reintegration mea- sures and ergonomic advice.
