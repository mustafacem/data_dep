Governance: Ethics, Governance At Siemens, we believe that the way we do business is as

important as our business success. Our values and ethical principles are embedded in our Business Conduct Guidelines, which are mandatory throughout the company. In addition to embedding these principles in our own management systems, we extend them to our suppliers who are required to follow a comprehensive Code of Conduct. Beyond that, we have made sustainability criteria an integral part of our long-term variable compensation programs1 for both the Managing Board and our senior management.2
