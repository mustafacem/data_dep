sustainability strategy.

By providing innovative technologies, we see ourselves as a leading decarbonization partner to our customers and society in general. To fulfill this role, we need to have a precise understanding of the technological changes that must be made in the next few decades and beyond. We rely primarily on scenarios from S&P Global (formerly IHS Markit), IEA, and BloombergNEF to plan our business strategy and identify company-wide risks and opportunities. These scenarios help us, for example, to identify trends in the energy and mobility markets. For business planning purposes, we apply different scenarios like the S&P Global Green Rules (our baseline scenario), Inflections, and two net zero scenarios (ACCS, MTM); and IEA STEPS, APS, NZE, and BloombergNEF New Energy Outlook (Economic Transition Scenario, net zero scenario). These scenarios help us predict market developments, assess the implications of various scenarios, and make business decisions on this basis. With a view to our own business, analyzing climate-related scenarios allows us to predict the potential consequences in terms of regulatory requirements, R&D, and customer trends and requirements. Our business units also conduct business-specific scenario analyses.
