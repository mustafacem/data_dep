Combined Management Report

Supply chain management: The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management for components, sub-assemblies, energy, critical parts (e.g. semiconductors) and materials. Capacity constraints and supply shortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production bottlenecks, delivery delays, quality issues and additional costs. We also rely on third parties to supply us with parts, components and services. Using third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product delivery schedules and costs. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems in the future, especially if we use single-source suppliers for critical components. Shortages and delays could materially harm our businesses. Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence of catastrophic events (including pandemics), geopolitical uncertainties, energy shortages, sabotage, cyber incidents, suppliersâ€™ financial difficulties or suppliers not meeting our standards, particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely manner or at all. Besides other measures, we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with various hedging instruments.
