Goodwill â€“ Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash- generating units, generally represented by a segment. Siemens Healthineers is tested one level below the segment. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
