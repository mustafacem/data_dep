For over ten years we have supported One Young World (OYW), a non-profit organization that supports young busi- ness leaders around the globe to build a better world with more responsible, more effective leadership. At the 2023 OYW Summit in Belfast, we championed this event by send- ing more than 45 of our Siemens colleagues to participate.

Siemens collaborates with numerous partners globally across the topics of decarbonization and energy efficiency, resource efficiency and circularity, and people-centricity and societal impact. Our selected strategic sustainability partner- ships are listed below.
