Generally, the operating units conclude their hedging activities internally with Corporate Treasury. By applying a cost-optimizing portfolio approach, Corporate Treasury itself hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks with external counterparties and limits them.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a reasonably possible change in the euro versus the most important currency exchange rates compared to the respective year-end exchange rates. The analysis does not include effects of foreign currency translation. The effect on net income is due to changes in the fair values of monetary assets and liabilities including non- designated foreign currency derivatives and embedded derivatives. The effect on equity is due to changes in the fair values of forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. In fiscal 2023, the sensitivity of net income with regard to the U.S. dollar decreased compared to the prior year mainly due to a decrease of monetary assets and liabilities and a higher hedge ratio. The sensitivity of equity with regard to the U.S. dollar decreased due to a decline in the nominal amount of U.S. dollar forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
