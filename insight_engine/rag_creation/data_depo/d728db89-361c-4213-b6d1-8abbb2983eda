Responsible Product Development

Clean Supply Chain

Efficient Own Operations

Products and solutions are at the core of our business. Evaluating our portfolio and applying an Ecodesign approach to rele- vant product families supports us in selling eco-efficient products and solutions.

A clean supply chain is central to the journey of decoupling natural resource use. That is why we will increasingly source secondary materials and take action to replace regu- lated substances according to IEC 62474.

At the heart of our environmental approach is our ability to efficiently manage our production sites and offices â€“ especially by enhancing waste management practices and using clean energy.
