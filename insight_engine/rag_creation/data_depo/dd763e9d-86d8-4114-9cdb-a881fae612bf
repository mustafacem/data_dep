8.1 Report on expected developments

8.1.1 Worldwide economy

The global economy showed remarkable resilience in calendar 2023, given the number of headwinds and negative economic shocks from the previous year. Nevertheless, these shocks still have adverse implications for economic growth in calendar 2024, especially the dampening effects of tighter financial conditions. Accordingly, in calendar 2024 the global economy is expected to further slow down to 2.3% GDP growth, after 2.6% in calendar 2023. Given the high number of active and potential geopolitical conflicts, the outlook is subject to a high level of uncertainty.
