The source of the emissions factors applied in the 2023 reporting year is the “IEA Emissions Factors 2022” published by the International Energy Agency. For example, the global CO2e emissions factor used for electricity generation only is 461 g CO2e/kWh. If regional calculations are available, local emissions factors should be used.
