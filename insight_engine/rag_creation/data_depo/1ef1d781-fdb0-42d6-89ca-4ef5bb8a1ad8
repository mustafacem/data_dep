In addition to the programs mentioned above, in fiscal 2023 we supported the Innovation4Sustainability bootcamp, a local initiative for more than 30 students from public STEM schools across Egypt. The bootcamp was designed and developed with the intention of solving industrial waste management challenges in the electronics sector by empow- ering a group of diverse students through a series of hands-on trainings, workshops, and ideation using an agile methodology throughout the bootcamp.

In Argentina, we worked with the Siemens Foundation Argen- tina to design a 30-hour internationally certified training pro- gram based on Siemensâ€™ 3D design software. The program provides an up-to-date technical education that meets the needs and requirements of the socio-productive sector and aims to enhance employability by helping bridge the digital divide for more than 2,500 students and 250 teachers.
