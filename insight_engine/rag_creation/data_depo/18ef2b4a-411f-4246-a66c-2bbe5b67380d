Compliance risk management and compliance reviews as part of the CMS aim to identify compliance risks at an early stage and thus enable to take appropriate and effective measures to avoid or minimize risks. The risk assessment is also integrated into individual business processes and tools. The results of CMS that are relevant to the Group are taken into account as part of the Company-wide ERM.

The Compliance Control Program aims to ensure compliance with and implementation of the CMS and processes used worldwide. It is part of the ICS and is continuously further developed and adapted to the current Siemens guidelines. In addition, current compliance issues are discussed at the management level on a regular basis.
