Engagement with stakeholders To highlight our culture of trust and empowerment, we are

pursuing two initiatives that concentrate on understanding and taking account of our peopleâ€™s experiences and recog- nizing their achievements:

We use the results of our Siemens Global Engagement Survey (SGES)2 at regular intervals to assess the efficiency and success of our actions and to derive any necessary steps for improvement. In January 2023, we had a response rate for the SGES of 65% (decrease of 4 percentage points from the year before). Our People Net Promoter Score (pNPS) was 39 (+3 points from the prior year).
