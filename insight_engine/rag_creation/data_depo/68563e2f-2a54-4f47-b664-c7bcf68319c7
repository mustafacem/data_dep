Foundation: Corporate governance We believe that compliance with recognized principles of

corporate governance is the cornerstone of sustainability- based corporate management. Siemens AG is governed by German corporate law, under which it has a two-tier board structure consisting of a Managing Board and a Supervisory Board.

As the top management body, the Managing Board is responsible for serving the companyâ€™s best interests and for achieving sustainable growth in company value. The Managing Board members are responsible for the entire management of the company and decide on key issues of business policy and corporate strategy.
