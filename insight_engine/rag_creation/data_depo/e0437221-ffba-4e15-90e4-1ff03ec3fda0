8.1.3 Overall assessment

Our outlook for the Siemens Group for fiscal 2024 is based on the assumption that geopolitical tensions do not further increase. Under this condition, we expect our Industrial Business to continue its profitable growth.

For the Siemens Group we expect comparable revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8% and a book-to-bill ratio above 1.

We expect profitable growth of our Industrial Business to drive an increase in EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment to a range of €10.40 to €11.00 in fiscal 2024, up from EPS pre PPA excluding Siemens Energy Investment of €9.93 in fiscal 2023.
