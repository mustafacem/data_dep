NOTE 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates

Certain of the following accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the Companyâ€™s results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where Siemens reasonably could have used a different estimate in the current accounting period. Siemens cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require adjustment.
