In May 2021, Siemens AG and the Federal Republic of Germany entered into a public-law contract based on which the obligation of final disposal of nuclear waste is transferred to the Federal Republic of Germany for a payment of €360 million. The contract and therefore the payment is subject to the approval of the EU commission under state-aid rules. Estimation uncertainties still relate to assumptions made to measure the obligations that remain with Siemens AG, with regard to conditioning and packaging of nuclear waste, as well as intermediate storage and transport to the final storage facility “Schacht Konrad” or a logistics depot until year-end 2032.
