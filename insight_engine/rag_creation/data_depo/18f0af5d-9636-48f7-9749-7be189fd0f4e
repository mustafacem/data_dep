Revenue KPI

The revenue KPI shows the ratio of revenue from Taxonomy-eligible and/or aligned economic activities to the total revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the reporting year. Based on an assessment of the Siemens business portfolio, Taxonomy-eligible revenue accounted for 20.3% and Taxonomy-aligned revenue for 16.5% of total revenue. This translates into €15.7 billion in Taxonomy- eligible revenue and €12.8 billion in aligned revenue.

Taxonomy-eligible and aligned economic activities were primarily driven by the (i) Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport (Climate Change Mitigation, CCM 3.3), (ii) rail transportation infrastructure (CCM 6.14), (iii) Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport (CCM 6.15), all associated with Mobility businesses, as well as (iv) energy-efficient building technologies (CCM 3.5) and (v) services for energy-efficient building technologies (CCM 7.5), both related to Smart Infrastructure businesses.
