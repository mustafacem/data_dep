These trends were primary contributors for the significant slowdown of the Chinese economy during calendar 2023, after it started very dynamically in the first quarter of calendar 2023 following lifting of severe COVID-19 lockdowns. Another main contributor for the slowdown was the intensification of the country’s real estate crisis. Hence, China’s GDP is expected to grow by only 5% in calendar 2023, which is regarded as low because under multiple lockdowns in calendar 2022, China delivered GDP growth of only 3% and some catching- up in 2023 was expected.
