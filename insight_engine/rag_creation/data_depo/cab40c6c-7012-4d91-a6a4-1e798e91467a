Measurement â€“ Segments

Accounting policies for Segment information are generally the same as those used for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment information is disclosed for continuing operations. For internal and segment reporting purposes, intercompany lease transactions, however, are classified as operating leases by the lessor and are accounted for off-balance sheet by the lessee (except for intercompany leases with Siemens Healthineers as lessees). Intersegment transactions are based on market prices.
