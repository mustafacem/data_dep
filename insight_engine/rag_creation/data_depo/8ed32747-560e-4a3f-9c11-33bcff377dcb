Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets – The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets’ recoverable amount, which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.
