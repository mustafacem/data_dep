Financial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally, if the limitation period expired, when a debtorâ€™s sworn statement of affairs is received, or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. Receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.

A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. Significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset; for insignificant modifications, the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition.
