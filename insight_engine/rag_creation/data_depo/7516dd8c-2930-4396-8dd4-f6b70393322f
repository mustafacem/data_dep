SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 104

We are continuously striving to improve our impact on social cohesion. A major challenge in recent years included unfore- seen events like the global pandemic and the war in Ukraine. To help those affected, we launched a charity program in Germany and will continue to roll it out in other countries to better coordinate our measures and offer our people options for help.
