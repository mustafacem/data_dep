Nonetheless, they are consistent with the DEGREE sustain- ability framework and the global nonfinancial programs and initiatives at Siemens.

Data collection Given the size and worldwide presence of Siemens, data

collection poses a logistical challenge. Moreover, our compa- nies throughout the world need to comply with national regulations on the compilation and definition of their key figures, which means that the generated data is not always comparable. Where applicable, we point out any significant limitations in the information presented in the Report.

The data presented in this Report is collected via various internal reporting systems, which for the most part are dif- ferent from those used to collect the financial information presented in our consolidated financial statements. In partic- ular, the internal reporting systems used to collect the information presented in this Report may be subject to less stringent internal requirements for documentation, data generation, and auditing, including with respect to the IT systems and controls employed. We reserve the right to change the internal guidelines applicable to the collection of the data published in this Report without prior notice. Due to rounding, some of the numbers presented in this Report may not add up precisely to the totals presented, and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures to which they refer.
