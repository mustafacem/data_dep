campaigns and participating in cleanup events.

For our Siemens Campus in Erlangen, we have developed a comprehensive biodiversity concept that enables us to preserve existing trees, plant native fruit trees, and create suitable nesting habitats for many species, among other initiatives.

To further develop our approach to biodiversity, we have entered a strategic partnership with The Biodiversity Consul- tancy to help Siemens scientifically assess our biodiversity footprint. This assessment was conducted in fiscal 2023 and covered the biodiversity impacts of our own operations and those of our upstream value chain: for instance, impacts of the raw materials we purchase. The assessment and the transparency we acquired on our biodiversity footprint are an important step toward developing our biodiversity strategy.
