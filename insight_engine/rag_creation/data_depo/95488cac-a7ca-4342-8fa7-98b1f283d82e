Revenues from software contracts: Software contracts usually comprise the sale of subscription licenses and perpetual licenses, which are both on-premise, as well as technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades and the sale of software-as-a- service. Subscription contracts generally contain two separate performance obligations: time-based software license and technical support service. Revenues for perpetual and time-based licenses granting the customer a right to use Siemens’ intellectual property are recognized at a point in time, i.e. when control of the license passes to the customer. Revenues for technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades are recognized over time on a straight-line basis as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by Siemens’ services. Software-as-a-service contracts including related cloud services represent one performance obligation for which revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis. Payment terms for all transactions are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.
