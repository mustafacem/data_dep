People centricity & societal impact We enable our partners and customers to improve peopleâ€™s

lives today and transform the backbone of societies for a better tomorrow. For instance, our technologies support the well-being, productivity, safety, and security of building tenants and operators. Similarly, in the field of mobility, passengers and operators benefit from greater safety and convenience thanks to our technologies. They also promote the socioeconomic development of communities by enabling access to basic goods, resilient electric power, affordable real estate, food and water, healthcare, education, and public transportation.
