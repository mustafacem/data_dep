It is our top priority to contribute to the objectives set out in the Paris Agreement, which includes the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. As a global technology company, we acknowledge that our activities along the value chain – including procurement, product design, production, and the use of our products and services – generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (here- after CO2e emissions). This is contributing to a global tem- perature increase and other irreversible changes to our planet and ecosystems.
