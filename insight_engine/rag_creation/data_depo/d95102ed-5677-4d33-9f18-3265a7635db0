When applied alone, this metric does not reflect all of our portfolio’s positive impacts on our partners and customers. Software, electrification, and automation technology and other “enabling technologies” play a crucial role in achieving global environmental goals by providing systems that sup- port the transition to a low-carbon economy. For example, solutions from Smart Infrastructure can facilitate the trans- formation to an electrification of the global energy system. Even though they do not show a direct decarbonization impact on the product level, the electrification and automa- tion products sold by Smart Infrastructure in fiscal 2023 contributed to the decarbonization of power generation systems by avoiding 4.6 million metric tons of CO2e emis- sions. The description of our methodology for calculating these “enabling” customer avoided emissions can be found in our REPORTING PRINCIPLES FOR CUSTOMER AVOIDED EMISSIONS. However, because there is no recognized market standard for a calculation methodology to quantify these enabling or
