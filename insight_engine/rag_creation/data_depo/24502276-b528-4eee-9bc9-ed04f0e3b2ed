Asset Liability Matching Strategies

As a significant risk, the Company considers a decline in the plansâ€™ funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters. Accordingly, Siemens implemented a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit obligations (Asset Liability Matching). Risk management is based on a worldwide defined risk threshold (Value at Risk). The concept, the Value at Risk and the asset development including the investment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis under consultation of senior external experts. Independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk evaluation. Derivatives are used to reduce risks as part of risk management.
