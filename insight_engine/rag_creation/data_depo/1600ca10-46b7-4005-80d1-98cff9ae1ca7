Materiality assessment We updated our materiality assessment with an emphasis

on our industrial businesses Digital Industries, Smart Infra- structure, and Mobility in fiscal 2023 based on the GRI 2021 standards. Our aim was to identify our company’s key eco- nomic, ecological, and social impacts on the environment and society in accordance with the updated GRI Standards. The resulting topics also align with Siemens Healthineers’ (SHS) material topics, which were determined in an indepen- dent materiality assessment.
