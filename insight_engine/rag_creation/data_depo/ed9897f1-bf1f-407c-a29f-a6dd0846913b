The significance of environmental protection is continuously increasing. In a rapidly growing global economy characterized by ongoing urbanization and rising population numbers, Siemens supports a number of global green transformation initiatives. These initiatives include the European Green Deal, which aims to transition to a circular economy, restore biodiversity, reduce pollutant emissions into the environ- ment, reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030, and achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
