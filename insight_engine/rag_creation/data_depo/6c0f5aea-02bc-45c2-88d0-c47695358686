different parameters in order to best reflect the amount of avoided emissions during the entire use phase of a Siemens offering, similar to the calculation of downstream Scope 3 emissions. The calculation parameters (e.g., emission factors or expected use phase duration) should be reviewed and updated regularly in order to reflect the most current status of these numbers. The calculation approach should be consistent with the calculation of downstream Scope 3 emissions (Categories 11 and 15).

In some cases, the actual parameters, like the productâ€™s operating time or intended intensity of use by the customer, cannot be reliably determined. Under these circumstances, conservative estimates should be applied and documented appropriately. In general, the emissions of the reference scenario and the Siemens offering should include the poten- tial development of the situation over time. The calculation of future emissions from products with long lifespans is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Using an energy scenario to describe a changing emission factor would lead to incomparable calculation results whenever the scenario is updated. Therefore, we decided to use the annually updated emission factors, which incorporate the changes in the global energy mix from year to year, in a manner consistent with the calculation of our downstream Scope 3 emissions.
