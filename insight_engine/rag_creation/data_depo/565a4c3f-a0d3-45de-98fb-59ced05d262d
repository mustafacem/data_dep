The sensitivity analysis for the groups of cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill is allocated was based on a reduction in after-tax future cash flows by 10% or an increase in after-tax discount rates by one percentage point or a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by one percentage point. Siemens concluded that no impairment loss would need to be recognized on goodwill in any of these groups of cash-generating units.
