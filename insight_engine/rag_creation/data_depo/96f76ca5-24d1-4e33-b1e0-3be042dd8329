For this we also assessed the accounting for contractually agreed options, contract amendments or contract terminations (including related pending legal proceedings) also in relation to previous construction-type contracts with Russian customers. We also assessed the recognition requirements of reimbursement claims.

We further performed inquiries of project management (both commercial and technical project managers) with respect to the development of the projects, the reasons for deviations between planned and actual costs, the current estimated costs to complete the projects, and managementâ€™s assessments on probabilities that contract risks and claims from joint and several liability will materialize.
