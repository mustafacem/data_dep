Corporate Governance Statement

The Supervisory Board has not established a dedicated sustainability committee. Sustainability is one of the focus topics of the Supervisory Board’s work. Sustain ability is of such central importance for Siemens that it is discussed regularly and in detail at the Supervisory Board’s plenary meetings. As a crosscutting issue, sustainability touches on the areas of responsibility of several committees. To the extent that sustainability affects reporting, the Audit Committee considers sustainabilityrelated questions in detail and reports on these matters at the Supervisory Board’s plenary meet ings. To prepare for discussions and decisions at these meetings, the sustainabilityrelated aspects of Managing Board compensation are dealt with in the Compensation Committee.
