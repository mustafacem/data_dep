Financing, eliminations and other items included a revaluation loss of €0.2 billion on the stake in Thoughtworks Holding Inc. (fiscal 2022: a loss of €0.3 billion). For comparison, fiscal 2022 included also impacts totaling €0.5 billion at Corporate Treasury, resulting from the sale of Siemens’ financing and leasing business in Russia, as well as a loss of €0.1 billion resulting from applying hyperinflation accounting. These effects were partly offset in fiscal 2022 by a gain of €0.5 billion in connection with an investment accounted for using the equity method mainly due to fair value measurement.
