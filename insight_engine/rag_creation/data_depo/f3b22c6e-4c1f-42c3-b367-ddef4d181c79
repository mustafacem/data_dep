Siemens reviews associates and joint ventures for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that its investment is impaired, for example a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. In addition, Siemens similarly assesses whether there are indications that an impairment loss recorded in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. If this is the case, any reversal of an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount subsequently increases, not exceeding the carrying amount, had no impairment loss been recognized in previous periods. Impairments and reversal of impairments include the use of judgements.
