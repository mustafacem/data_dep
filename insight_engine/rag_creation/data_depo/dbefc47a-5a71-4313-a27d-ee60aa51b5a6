Demand within the industries served by Portfolio Companies mainly shows a delayed response to changes in the overall economic environment. Financial results are strongly dependent, however, on customer investment cycles in their key industries. In commodity- based industries such as oil and gas or mining, these cycles are driven mainly by commodity price fluctuations rather than changes in produced volumes. The heterogonous industrial customer base of the separately managed units requires a dedicated sales approach based on in-depth understanding of specific industries and customer requests, resulting in the use of various sales and marketing channels for Portfolio Companies.
