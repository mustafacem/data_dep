Revenue recognition on construction-type contracts

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The Group conducts a significant portion of its business under construction-type contracts, particularly in the Mobility business. Revenue from long-term construction-type contracts is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, generally over time under the percentage-of-completion method. We consider the accounting for construction-type contracts to be an area posing a significant risk of material misstatement (including the potential risk of management override of internal controls) and accordingly a key audit matter, because managementâ€™s assessments significantly impact the determination of the extent of progress towards completion. These assessments include, in particular, the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill contractually defined obligations, total estimated contract costs, remaining costs to completion and total estimated contract revenues, as well as contract risks including technical, political, regulatory, legal and supply chain risks.
