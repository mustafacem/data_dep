Holistic environmental protection

Management approach Siemens is a global company with locations all over the

world and activities across a wide range of markets. With our global reach, we aim to minimize our negative impacts and maximize our positive impacts on the environment: from the production of raw materials for our products and in our supply chain and our own production operations to the use, recycling, and disposal of those products.

Our internal sustainability network includes environmental officers at our sites and specialists in product-related envi- ronmental protection. The Environmental Protection depart- ment is developing programs to support Siemensâ€™ businesses in their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our operations and promote resource efficiency. The Sustainability department is responsible for the consolidated Siemens GHG reporting and our Net Zero Operations Program.
