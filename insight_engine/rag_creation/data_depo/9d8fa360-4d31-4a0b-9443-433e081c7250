Revenue growth

For comparable revenue, we expect the Siemens Group to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 4% to 8%. Furthermore, we anticipate that orders in fiscal 2024 will exceed revenue for a book-to-bill ratio above 1.

As of September 30, 2023, our order backlog totaled €111 billion, and we expect conversion from the backlog to strongly support revenue growth in fiscal 2024 with approximately €43 billion of past orders converted to current revenue. For expected conversion of order backlog to revenue for our respective segments, see chapter 3 Segment information.
