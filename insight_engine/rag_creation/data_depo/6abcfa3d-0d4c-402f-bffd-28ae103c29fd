Combined Management Report

Although the broad range of businesses is operating in diverse markets, overall the main markets served by Portfolio Companies are generally impacted by uncertainties regarding geopolitical and economic developments which tend to trigger customer caution regarding purchasing decisions. After the post-pandemic recovery, a normalizing growth momentum is expected in most end-customer vertical markets in fiscal 2024.

At the beginning of fiscal 2024, Large Drives Applications and certain business activities which were transferred from Digital Industries are combined in the areas of low- to high-voltage motors, geared motors, medium-voltage converters and motor spindles under a new separately managed unit, Innomotics. If the transfer from Digital Industries had already existed at the beginning of fiscal 2023, Portfolio Companies would have posted orders of €5,317 million, revenue of €4,699 million, profit of €457 million and a profit margin of 9.7%. Portfolio Companies’ order backlog amounted to €5 billion at the beginning of fiscal 2024, of which €3 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.
