As a result of the developments described in chapter 3, Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by 57%. Severance charges for continuing operations were €430 million, of which €351 million were in Industrial Business. In fiscal 2022, severance charges for continuing operations were €272 million, of which €190 million were in Industrial Business.

The tax rate in fiscal 2023 was 24% (fiscal 2022: 38%), benefiting from tax-free gains in relation to the partial reversal of an impairment on Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. Moreover, the gain recorded in connection with the capital increase by Siemens Energy AG was also tax-free. These positive influences on the tax rate were partly offset by our participation in the after-tax loss at Siemens Energy, which was not tax-deductible. As a result, the increase in Income from continuing operations was 93%.
