Income taxes – Tax positions are calculated taking into consideration the respective local tax laws, relevant court decisions and applicable tax authorities’ views. Tax regulations can be complex and possibly subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities. Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on management’s considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected tax consequences of future periods attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, including income from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning opportunities that Siemens would execute. As of each period-end, Siemens evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets, based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits. As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens’s control, assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will recover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption.
