Regarding our approach to respecting human rights, we have established measures that encompass our own operations, our supply chain, and customer-related business activities.

Continuous improvement measures We view fulfilling our responsibility to human rights as a

continuous improvement journey. In fiscal 2023, Siemens modified its policies, processes, and methods to align with regulatory requirements like the LkSG. We have established a cross-functional Committee with the aim of ensuring gov- ernance oversight and decision-making on future measures related to the LkSG.
