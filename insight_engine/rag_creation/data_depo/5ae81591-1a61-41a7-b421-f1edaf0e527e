In connection with the due date and settlement of the Stock Awards for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, the tables also include the additional cash payments to eligible Managing Board members as a result of the Siemens Energy spin-off. The spin-off of Siemens Energy in fiscal 2020 led to adjustments in the stock-based compensation allocations agreed upon until the spin-off date. At the time when the 2019 and 2018 Stock Awards became due, the Managing Board members – like all other eligible employees – were, accordingly, entitled to receive an additional cash payment based on the spin-off ratio of 2:1 and on the Siemens Energy share price of €14.68 and €24.32, respectively, on the date when their respective stock- based compensation allocations became due.
