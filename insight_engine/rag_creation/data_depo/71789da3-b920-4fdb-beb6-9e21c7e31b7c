Among many bolt-on acquisitions including Corindus Vascular Robotics and Mendix Group, two o Siemens' key portfolio adjustments are the spin-off of Siemens Energy in 2020, and the acquisition of the very profitable global radiation therapy market leader Varian Medical Systems (VMS), completed in 2021, to strengthen Siemens Healthineers (SHS), its 75.4%-owned health care subsidiary. The spin-off of Siemens Energy resulted in the deconsolidation of â‚¬27 billion of revenues and reduced the group's exposure to long-term project execution risks materially. Since then, Siemens has further reduced its stake to about 17% (as of Dec. 31, 2023).
