Smart Infrastructure’s R&D activities focus on sustainable and decarbonizing offerings for buildings, utilities and industrial customers. Smart Infrastructure develops digital offerings for stable operation of electrical grids with a high share of renewable energy. In this regard, data from field devices is the basis for intelligent grid control and protection, providing grid flexibility and continuously matching energy supply and demand while protecting grid assets. Furthermore, it develops technologies for environmentally friendly and increasingly renewable-based energy systems, ranging from climate-friendly F-gas-free switchgear for medium voltage to charging solutions for e- mobility and grid integration of green hydrogen production. R&D efforts also strengthen Smart Infrastructure’s capabilities to improve the sustainability, performance and attractiveness of buildings. Smart Infrastructure is expanding its digital offerings such as cloud solutions using field data from controllers and IoT devices and the business platform Building X on the principles of openness and modularity of Siemens Xcelerator. These and other offerings are enhanced using AI and large language models. For electrical distribution systems and industrial plants, Smart Infrastructure continuously drives digitalization of its switching and control products with connectivity to the cloud, remote diagnostics and edge computing capability. Smart Infrastructure puts an increasing focus of R&D on the sustainability of its products along the lifecycle, incorporating environmentally friendly designs, materials and processes. To a large extent, its capital expenditures relate to the products businesses. Main investment areas are replacement of fixed assets and further digitalization of factories and technical equipment, with a strong focus on innovation.
