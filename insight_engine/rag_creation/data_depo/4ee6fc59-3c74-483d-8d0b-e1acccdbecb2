knowledge and awareness of our employees of environmental protection. To this end, Siemens has implemented mandatory awareness trainings on environmental topics for all employees as it is covered in the Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines.

Our information campaigns on World Environment Day and Earth Overshoot Day aim to raise awareness of environmen- tal protection in a global context. As part of the “Thank You” campaign, we recognize employees who have made excep- tional contributions to environmental conservation, and we share their portraits and success stories on our Siemens World internal information platform.
