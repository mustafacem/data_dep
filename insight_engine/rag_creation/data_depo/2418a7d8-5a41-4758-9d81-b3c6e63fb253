New Supervisory Board members can meet with Manag- ing Board members and other managers with specialist responsibility to exchange views on current topics and topics of fundamental importance and thus gain an overview of Company-relevant matters (onboarding). In fiscal 2023, a separate informational event for the new members of the Supervisory Board was held on March 13, 2023, to familiarize those members, in particular, with the Companyâ€™s business model and strategy and with the structures of the Siemens Group. As part of this onboard- ing program, Supervisory Board members also have the opportunity to visit the various locations of different Siemens business areas and gain an insight into the port- folio as well as production and manufacturing methods. Longer-serving Supervisory Board members may also attend onboarding events and regularly do so.
