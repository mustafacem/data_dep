Order intake at Mobility exceeded the record level a year earlier on sharply higher volume from large orders. Contract wins in fiscal 2023 were highlighted by an order worth €2.9 billion for locomotives and associated maintenance in India, a €2.5 billion order for the first line of a turnkey rail system in Egypt and a €2.1 billion order for suburban trains in Germany. Order intake a year earlier included among others an order worth €1.5 billion for high-speed trains in Germany. Revenue rose on growth in nearly all businesses with the strongest contribution coming from the rolling stock business, and was supported by improved availability of components. On a geographic basis, revenue grew in all three reporting regions. Nominal volume development was held back by the fiscal 2022 divestment of Yunex Traffic, resulting in a portfolio effect which took four percentage points from order growth and five percentage points from revenue growth in the current period. As with revenue, profit and profitability rose in nearly all businesses. Profit in fiscal 2023 included a positive €0.2 billion in trailing effects related to the winding down of business activities in Russia a year earlier, which burdened prior-year profit by €0.6 billion in impairments and other charges. In addition, profit in fiscal 2022 included impacts from supplier delays and COVID-19 effects. These burdens were largely offset by a gain of €0.7 billion from the sale of Yunex Traffic. Severance charges were €25 million, compared to €27 million a year earlier. Mobility’s order backlog rose to €45 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which €11 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.
