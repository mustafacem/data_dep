The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the measurement and completeness of deferred tax liabilities.
