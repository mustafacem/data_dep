Revenue was higher in nearly all our industrial businesses and rose to â‚¬77.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries contributed double-digit growth with all businesses posting increases. Revenue growth at Smart Infrastructure was led by the electrification and the electrical products businesses, while at Digital Industries the factory automation and the process automation businesses contributed the strongest growth. Revenue growth at Mobility was led by a significant increase in the rolling stock business. Revenue at Siemens Healthineers remained on the prior-year level as growth particularly in the imaging and Varian businesses was offset by a decline in the diagnostics business. Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects, revenue for Siemens rose 11%. We thus exceeded the forecast provided in our Combined Management Report for fiscal 2022, which was to achieve comparable revenue growth in the range of 6% to 9%, and reached the upper end of our subsequently raised outlook, which was to achieve 9% to 11% in comparable revenue growth.
