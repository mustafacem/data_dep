To identify anomalies in the development of margins and other project KPIs, we also applied data analysis procedures. In designing our audit procedures, we also considered results from project audits conducted by the internal audit function. Furthermore, we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects (e.g., project acceptance documentation, contractual terms and conditions, and lawyersâ€™ confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims) and inspected the status of projects at plant sites. Due to the large contract volume and risk profile, our audit procedures focused on large contracts for delivery of high-speed and commuter trains.
