As a result, the S&P Global Ratings EBITDA margin has steadily improved and reached 17.3% in fiscal 2023 compared with 12.0%-14.6% between 2009 and 2020. In our base case, we estimate the group's profitability will further improve, with adjusted EBITDA margins reaching 17.5%-18.0% in fiscal 2024 and more than 18% in fiscal 2025 as a result of higher revenues, better pricing, and productivity gains. In particular, we expect positive dynamics from its smart infrastructure and mobility sectors to support the group's revenue growth and margin expansion. FOCF is likely to remain strong as well, at about €7 billion in fiscal 2024 compared with €8 billion in fiscal 2023. We expect a further increase in fiscal 2025 to about €7.5 billion. Given the more moderate revenue growth and continued normalization of supply chains, we estimate that working capital requirements will start to ease in fiscal 2024 and continue in fiscal 2025.
