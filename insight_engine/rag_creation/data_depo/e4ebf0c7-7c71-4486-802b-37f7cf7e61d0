In the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions, we evaluated whether management’s assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year 2023, which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions, was in compliance with tax law. In particular, this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters, such as the determination of transfer prices, the results of tax field audits, the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate (intragroup) restructuring activities. In order to assess measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions, we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. Further, we evaluated management’s assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the Siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law.
