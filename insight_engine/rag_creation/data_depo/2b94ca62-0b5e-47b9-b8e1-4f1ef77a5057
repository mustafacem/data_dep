What did the economic and political environment look like at the start of fiscal 2023?

Siemens AG began fiscal 2023 spurred by a strong performance in fiscal 2022. However, the economic and political environment still contained a large number of uncertainties. Although new variants of the coronavirus did not produce the negative impacts feared and a crisis in gas and electricity supplies failed to materialize, the economic situation began to weaken – particularly in Germany, the Company’s home market. The war in Ukraine continued as did tensions between the western democracies and China. On the other hand, supply chain pressures eased. Due to a sharp increase in inflation, all major central banks raised their interest rates to levels not seen since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. In Europe, high energy prices burdened economic development, while, in the U.S., consumption and the labor market in particular proved to be very resilient despite the interest rate increases. Growth in China – which had been strong following the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in Q1 of fiscal 2023 – slowed due to the normalization of inventories, which had built up during the pandemic, and as a result of the burdens imposed by the crisis in China’s real estate market. Siemens AG’s markets benefited from high order backlogs, positive price developments and customers’ efforts to become more resilient, more competitive and more sustainable.
