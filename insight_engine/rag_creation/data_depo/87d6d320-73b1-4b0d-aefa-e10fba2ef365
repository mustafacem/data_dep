To drive additional transparency on our journey to 2030, we set an ambitious interim reduction target for our business operations at Siemens without SHS of 55% by 2025 com- pared to 2019.

By joining the RE100 initiative in 2021, we reinforced our commitment to a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030 at the latest. As part of our commitment to EV100, we are striving to completely convert our motor vehicle fleet to electric vehicles by 2030. Our EP100 pledge strengthens our commitment to only own or lease buildings that have no net CO2e emissions by 2030.
