Competitive environment: The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms and shifts in market demands. We face strong, established competitors as well as rising competitors from emerging markets and new industries, which may have a better cost structure or offer a better customer solution. Some industries in which we operate are undergoing consolidation, which may result in stronger competition, a change in our relative market position, an increase in inventory of finished or work-in-progress goods, or unexpected price erosion. Furthermore, there is a risk that critical suppliers could be taken over by competitors and a risk that competitors are increasingly offering services to our installed base. We address these risks with various measures, for example benchmarking, strategic initiatives, sales push initiatives, executing productivity measures and target cost projects, rightsizing of our footprint, outsourcings, mergers and joint ventures and optimizing our product and service portfolio. We continuously monitor and analyze competitive, market and industry information in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting to such changes.
