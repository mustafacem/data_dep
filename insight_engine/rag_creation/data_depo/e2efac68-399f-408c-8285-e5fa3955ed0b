Avoided emissions at customers

Customer avoided CO2e emissions are widely reported in the market; however, there is currently no universally accepted standard for their calculation. Therefore, approaches and results are often not comparable due to different definitions and product portfolios. Siemens is actively involved in a number of working groups and associations that are working to support the standardization of calculations and reporting of customer-related CO2e emissions: for example, we are involved with the WBCSD and the EU Green Digital Coalition.
