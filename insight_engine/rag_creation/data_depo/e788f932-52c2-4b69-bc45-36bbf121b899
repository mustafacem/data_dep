Siemens performs the mandatory annual impairment test in the three months ended September 30. Key assumptions on which Siemens based its determinations of the fair value less costs to sell for the (group of) cash-generating unit(s) being part of the segments include terminal value growth rates up to 1.9% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, and after-tax discount rates of 7.5% to 9.5% in fiscal 2023 and 6.5% to 9.0% in fiscal 2022.

To estimate the fair value less costs to sell of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, cash flows were projected for the next five years (in exceptional cases up to ten years) based on past experience, actual operating results and managementâ€™s best estimate about future developments as well as market assumptions. The determined fair value of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
