D. Comparative information on profit development and annual change in compensation

The following table shows, in accordance with Section 162 para. 1 sent. 2 No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), Siemens’ profit development, the annual change in the Managing Board and Supervisory Board members’ compensation and the annual change in average employee compensation on a full-time equivalent basis over the last five fiscal years.

Profit development is presented on the basis of the Siemens Group’s key performance indicators revenue, comparable revenue growth and basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations. Through fiscal 2021, the latter was also one of the financial targets for the short-term variable compensation (Bonus) of the Managing Board and thus had a significant influence on the amount of the compensation of the Managing Board members. Since fiscal 2022, the comparative information has also included basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation. This key performance indicator supersedes basic earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations in the Bonus in accordance with the Siemens Financial Framework, which has been in effect since fiscal 2022. In accordance with Section 275 para. 3 No. 16 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB), the development of the net income of Siemens AG is also shown.
