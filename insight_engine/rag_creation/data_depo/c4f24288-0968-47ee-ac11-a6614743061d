The use of biogas is another component of our decarboni- zation strategy. This has reduced our annual emissions by 13 thousand metric tons of CO2e compared to the use of conventional natural gas.

In the U.S. weâ€™ve conducted pilot purchases of over 3.6 mil- lion liters of sustainable aviation fuel.

Reducing motor fleet emissions We are working to reduce the emissions from our motor

vehicle fleet, which comprises around 44,000 vehicles, and are striving to electrify it completely by 2030 as part of our EV100 commitment. In fiscal 2023, these emissions totaled about 210 thousand metric tons of CO2e.
