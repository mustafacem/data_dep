5.5 Corporate citizenship

Actions and results

Scale sustainability impact with a shared value approach Grounded in our core business and competencies, we have

defined three strategic focus areas for our corporate citizen- ship activities: access to technology, access to education, and sustaining communities.

In addition to participating in traditional philanthropy, we leverage our technological expertise, capabilities, and prod- ucts to contribute to society.

In addition, by equipping research laboratories with control and automation equipment in countries like Hungary, Turkey, and Latvia, Siemens is helping improve educational and employment opportunities.
