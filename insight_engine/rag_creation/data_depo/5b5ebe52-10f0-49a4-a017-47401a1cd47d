Global megatrends Complexity in the industrial world has never been greater

than today. Several megatrends are driving us to rethink established ways of doing things:

→ Environmental change and the associated climate change,

along with extreme weather conditions like increasing flooding and drought, pose critical challenges. Current legislation alone is insufficient to effectively combat environmental change. We are also facing challenges related to resource efficiency and material extraction, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss.

→ In times of crisis, glocalization can create a greater balance between the global and the local in our economy. For instance, by ensuring production of our products and solutions near our customers, we can strengthen our resilience to shocks while also reducing the environmental impact of our products.
