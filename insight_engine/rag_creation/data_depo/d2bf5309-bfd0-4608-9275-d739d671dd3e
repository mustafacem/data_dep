Uncertain tax positions and recoverability of deferred tax assets

Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: The accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions, and was therefore a key audit matter. In particular, this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions as well as the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Auditorâ€™s response: With the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of tax law, we examined the processes installed by management for the identification, recognition and measurement of tax positions.
