Stage 3: If the financial asset is credit-impaired, valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is considered credit-impaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default, however, the definition of default is not yet met. Impairment triggers include liquidity problems, a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. A credit-risk driven contractual modification always results in a credit-impaired financial asset.
