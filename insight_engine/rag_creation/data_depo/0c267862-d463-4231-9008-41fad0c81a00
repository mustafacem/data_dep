→ Siemens does not provide any of the core components of a product, system, solution, service, or investment: Siemens reports no Customer Avoided Emissions.

Optional accounting of Customer Avoided Emissions So far, there are no robust calculation approaches to quantify

the decarbonization effect of all portfolio elements: for instance, software or automation technology. Some Siemens products, systems, solutions, or services are “enabling tech- nologies” and do not demonstrate a direct decarbonization effect on the product-level. Nevertheless, these enabling technologies can often be critical components needed for the transition to a low-carbon economy. One example are solutions from Smart Infrastructure which can facilitate the system transformation to an electrification of the global energy system. Therefore, quantifying these enabling decar- bonization impacts requires calculation approaches on a system level where these components are built in. Due to the lack of a commonly used external definition or standard, in fiscal 2023 Siemens began to account for these “indirect” or “enabling” decarbonization effects but has decided to report them separately for the purpose of transparency and conser- vativeness. The same accounting principles are applied as described above. With regard to the example from Smart Infrastructure, the calculation to determine the contribution to electrification and therefore decarbonization is based on the total global energy use and the share of electrification and automation solutions from Smart Infrastructure as part of the total global investment in electrification. The eligible revenue, based on the EU Taxonomy, is included in the calculation along with the grid mix evolution of electricity
