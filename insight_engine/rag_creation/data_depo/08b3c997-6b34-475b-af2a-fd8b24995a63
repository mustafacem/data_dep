(in millions of â‚¬)

Industrial Business recorded cash inflows from operating activities that exceeded its profit, with the highest contribution from Digital Industries. Cash outflows from changes in operating net working capital were due mainly to Siemens Healthineers which recorded a significant build-up of trade and other receivables as well as inventories due in part to the expected growth of business activities in coming quarters.

Cash outflows for purchase of investments and financial assets for investment purposes included additions of assets eligible as central bank collateral and payments for debt or equity investments.
