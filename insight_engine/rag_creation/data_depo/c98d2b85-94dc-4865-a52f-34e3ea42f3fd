To take account of the Companyâ€™s long-term performance and provide incentives for a sustainable increase in profit, the average EPS pre PPA of three consecutive fiscal years was used for target setting. The portfolio of Siemens AG changed significantly due to the spin-off of Siemens Energy at the end of fiscal 2020. Against this backdrop, target setting for fiscal 2023 was defined on the basis of comparable EPS pre PPA values. The following EPS pre PPA values were used for this purpose: the EPS pre PPA value of continuing operations was used for fiscal 2020, and the EPS pre PPA values of continuing and discontinued operations were used for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.
