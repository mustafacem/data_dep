Basis of consolidation – The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries over which the Company has control. Siemens controls an investee if it has power over the investee. In addition, Siemens is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from the involvement with the investee and Siemens is able to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of Siemens’ return.

Business combinations – Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). If there is no loss of control, transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting net income. At the date control is lost, any retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value. In case of a written put option on non-controlling interests the Company assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present ownership interest are fulfilled at the balance sheet date. If the Company is not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put option will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated as equity transaction between shareholders with the recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period.
