Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for disposal â€“ Discontinued operations are reported when a component of an entity is classified as held for disposal or has been disposed of, if the component represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to disposal. A non-current asset or a disposal group is held for disposal, if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than through continuing use. Depreciation and amortization cease for assets classified as held for disposal. In the Consolidated Statements of Income and of Cash Flows, discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing operations; prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. The disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements outside of Note 3 relate to continuing operations or assets and liabilities not held for disposal. The non-current asset held for disposal or the disposal group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain.
