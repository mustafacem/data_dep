Diversity also means gender diversity. According to the legal requirement applicable to Siemens AG (Section 76 para. 3a of the German Stock Corpora tion Act), the Managing Board must include at least one woman and at least one man (minimum partic ipation requirement). Beyond the minimum partici pation requirement, the consideration of women is an essential aspect of the Supervisory Boardâ€™s long term succession planning for the Managing Board.

It is considered helpful if different age groups are represented on the Managing Board. In accordance with the recommendation of the Code, the Super visory Board has defined an age limit for the mem bers of the Managing Board. In keeping with this limit, the members of the Managing Board are, as a rule, to be not older than 67 years of age.
