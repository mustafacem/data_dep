Our water risk analysis begins with an assessment of our environmentally relevant sites using the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas from the World Resources Institute (WRI). With the aid of an internal analytical tool, Siemens assesses local-level risks resulting from our sitesâ€™ activities, and then assesses them in relation to regional water risks. Sites with a high-risk assessment need to define targets to reduce the level of risk. In fiscal 2023, 96% of our sites implemented this water strategy.
