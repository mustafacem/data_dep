Progress on DEGREE ambition #8: Circularity through waste-to-landfill reduction of 50% by 2025 and toward zero landfill waste by 2030

Landfill waste is the type of waste with the greatest environmental impact. Thatâ€™s why we want to reduce both our hazardous and our non-hazardous landfill waste by 50% by fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2021 and have included these ambitions in our DEGREE sustainability framework as well as the Eco Efficiency @ Siemens program. With the aid of worldwide work- shops, we have developed and implemented measures to improve our waste management. Compared to the base year 2021, we reduced our landfill waste by 15%.
