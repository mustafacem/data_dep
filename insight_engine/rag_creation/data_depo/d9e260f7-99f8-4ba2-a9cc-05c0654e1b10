2.2 Profitability and capital efficiency

Within the Siemens Financial Framework, we aim to achieve over a cycle of three to five years margins that are comparable to those of our relevant competitors. Therefore, we have defined profit margin ranges for our industrial businesses which also consider the profit margins of their respective relevant competitors. Profit margin is defined as profit of the respective business divided by its revenue.

For our industrial businesses, profit represents EBITA adjusted for amortization of intangible assets not acquired in business combinations.
