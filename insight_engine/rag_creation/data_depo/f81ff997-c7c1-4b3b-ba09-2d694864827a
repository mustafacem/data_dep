GDP in China is expected to grow at only 4.6% in calendar 2024, after an anticipated growth of 5.0% in calendar 2023. The correction in the real estate sector will continue to weigh on GDP growth. During calendar 2024 global goods demand, world trade and industrial production are expected to modestly increase again. The main assumption behind this expectation is further normalization for two critical factors: consumer spending and the inventory policies of companies. Both weighed on industrial output in calendar 2023 but are expected to modestly support growth of the Chinese economy in calendar 2024. In addition, Chinese private consumption is expected to drive domestic demand and some tailwinds will come from announced stimulus measures.
