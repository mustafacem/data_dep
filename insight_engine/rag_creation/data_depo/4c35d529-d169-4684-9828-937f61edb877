- We therefore raised our long-term rating on Siemens AG to 'AA-' from 'A+'. We also affirmed our 'A-1+' short-term rating on the company.

- The stable outlook reflects our view that Siemens' operating performance will remain solid, such that the S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margin remains at or above 17% and FFO to debt remains above 45% with generally very significant headroom.
