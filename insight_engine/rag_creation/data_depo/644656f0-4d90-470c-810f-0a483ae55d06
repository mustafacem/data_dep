In the post-pandemic world, consumption patterns of households continued to normalize. In particular, the shift to goods from services triggered by COVID-19 ended and then reversed, with a strong rebound of the service sector including tourism, and a normalization of goods demand.

Accordingly, both global goods demand and trade were significantly weaker in calendar 2023.
