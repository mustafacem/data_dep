The base data used in preparing our financial statements consists of the closing data reported by the operations of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries. The preparation of the closing data of most of our entities is supported by an internal shared services organization. Furthermore, other accounting activities, such as governance and monitoring activities, are usually bundled on a regional level. In particular cases, such as valuations relating to post-employment benefits, we use external experts. The reported closing data is used to prepare the financial statements in the consolidation system. The steps necessary to prepare the financial statements are subject to both manual and automated controls.
