In addition, Siemens constantly monitors funding options available in the capital markets, as well as trends in the availability and costs of such funding, with a view to maintaining financial flexibility and limiting repayment risks.

The following table reflects our contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement, repayments and interest. The disclosed expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument and based on the earliest date on which Siemens could be required to pay. Cash outflows for financial liabilities (including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on the conditions existing at September 30, 2023.
