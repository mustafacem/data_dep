Siemens Mobility said Austrian's federal railways company OBB has ordered a first batch of 70 Mireo regional and long- distance trains.

The German railway company said Friday that the order, valued at more than 800 million euros ($870.1 million), forms part of a framework agreement awarded to Siemens Mobility at the end of summer last year.

The agreement to deliver up to 540 single-deck electric multiple-unit trains continues the manufacturer's development of its Mireo brand and its partnership with the Austrian operator.
