AND PRODUCTION ee)

Siemens is committed to using resources responsibly and recognizes that the circular economy offers highly beneficial opportunities for business, the environment, and society. By the end of this decade we want to evolve even more toward the circular economy, for example by increasing the percent- age of metals and plastics we procure as secondary materials. We also aim to reduce our amount of landfill waste. Siemens has worldwide strategic initiatives for the design phase to the end of lifecycle of its products and operations, and is committed to robust, ecologically friendly design. We apply disruptive technologies and innovative business models to make an active contribution to the circular economy.
