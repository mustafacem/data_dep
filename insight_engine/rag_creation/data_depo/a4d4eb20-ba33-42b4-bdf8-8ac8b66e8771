Sustainable growth through digital transformation The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly accelerated digitalization.

New business models are emerging, and the importance of collaborative partnerships within ecosystems is increasing, especially in the context of sustainability challenges that cannot be solved unilaterally. We need to achieve more, and we need to do it sustainably while consuming fewer resources. We can do this by increasing our efficiency with the help of new technologies and by working in ecosystems with new business models to keep resources in circulation.
