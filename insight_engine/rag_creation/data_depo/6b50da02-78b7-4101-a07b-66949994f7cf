The way that Siemens and our partners do business impacts the markets and societies where we operate. Unethical and unlawful conduct like corruption, cartel arrangements, and money laundering can distort competition, hinder economic development, and threaten human rights and democracy. As a global player, Siemens is responsible for setting an example in all its operations and in collaboration with all its stake- holders. By building alliances against corruption and pro- moting fair competition together with stakeholders from politics, business, and society, Siemens can through Collec- tive Action help establish the conditions for fair competition and thereby promote innovation.
