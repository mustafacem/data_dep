U.S.

In the U.S., the Pension Plans are sponsored by Siemens, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. Siemens has appointed the Investment Committee as the named fiduciary for the management of the assets of the Plans. The Plansâ€™ assets are held in Trusts and the trustees of the Trusts are responsible for the administration of the assets of the Trusts, taking directions from the Investment Committee. The Plans are subject to the funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA). There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of 80% in the defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions. At their discretion, sponsoring employers may contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement. Annual contributions are calculated by independent actuaries.
