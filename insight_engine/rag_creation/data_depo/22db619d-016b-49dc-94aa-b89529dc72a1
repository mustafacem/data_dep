4.1 Climate action

At Siemens we have developed our own method that meets our standards for high-quality and transparent metrics. We calculate the avoided emissions for all products and services sold and investments made by Siemens in each fiscal year over the course of their entire use phase at our customers. This approach aligns with the accounting principles defined for calculating Scope 3 emissions (Scope 3.11 Use of sold products) in the GHG Protocol. For a detailed description of our methodology for calculating customer avoided emis- sions, please see REPORTING PRINCIPLES FOR CUSTOMER AVOIDED EMISSIONS.
