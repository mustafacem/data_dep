Create a better #TomorrowWithUs to win and retain talents for Siemens as the inclusive employer of choice.

Our goal is to position Siemens as the inclusive employer of choice in all our relevant talent markets. This has also received external recognition, as Siemens has been listed among the “World’s Most Attractive Employers 2023” by Forbes and Universum, as well as in national rankings like LinkedIn “Top Company 2023” in Germany.
