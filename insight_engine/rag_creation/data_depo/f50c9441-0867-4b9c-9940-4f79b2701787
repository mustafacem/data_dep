In Q1 2024, Siemens increased revenue 6 percent on a comparable basis – that is, excluding currency translation and portfolio effects – to €18.4 billion (Q1 2023: €18.1 billion). Orders totaled €22.3 billion (Q1 2023: €22.6 billion), a 2 percent increase year-over-year on a comparable basis. The book-to-bill ratio was a strong 1.21. The order backlog was at the record level of €113 billion.

Profit Industrial Business totaled €2.7 billion, an increase of 3 percent and a new record for the first quarter of a fiscal year (Q1 2023: €2.7 billion). The profit margin of the Industrial Business improved to 15.8 percent (Q1 2023: 15.7 percent). Net income climbed 56 percent to €2.5 billion (Q1 2023: €1.6 billion), a particularly strong development that included a €0.5 billion gain from Siemens Energy Investment due to the transfer of an 8.0 percent stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. and the termination of at-equity method accounting. At €3.19, corresponding basic earnings per share before purchase price allocation accounting were 53 percent higher than in the prior-year quarter (Q1 2023: €2.08).
