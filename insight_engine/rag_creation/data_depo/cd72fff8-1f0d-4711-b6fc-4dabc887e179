wide sustainability strategy and on the status of this

strategy’s implementation. The Supervisory Board deals with both the risks and the opportunities for Siemens relating to social and environmental factors and the environmental and social impact of the Company’s activ ities. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee also concern themselves with sustainability reporting, which includes the Sustainability Report in addition to re porting on nonfinancial matters in the Combined Man agement Report, and are kept up to date on new developments and the status of their implementation at Siemens. In addition, the Supervisory Board appoints and dismisses the members of the Managing Board and determines each member ’s portfolios. The Supervisory Board approves – on the basis of a proposal by the Compensation Committee – the compensation system for Managing Board members and defines their concrete com pensation in accordance with this system. It sets the indi vidual targets for the variable compensation and the total compensation of each individual Managing Board mem ber, reviews the appropriateness of total compen sation and regularly reviews the Managing Board compensation system. Important Managing Board decisions – such as those regarding major acquisitions, divestments, fixed as set investments or financial measures – require Supervi sory Board approval unless the Bylaws for the Supervisory Board specify that such authority be delegated to the Inno vation and Finance Committee of the Supervisory Board.
