Controls All data protection requirements and measures at Siemens

are subject to regular controls. Siemens conducts risk-based data protection audits of its processing activities, products, and services.

Treatment of data protection violations In the event of a potential data protection violation, a rapid

response is essential to ensuring that the violation is swiftly stopped and corrected. To facilitate this, Siemens has estab- lished a global Data Privacy Incident Process that uses central reporting channels and aims to immediately inform all internal and external stakeholders (including the data subjects and regulatory authorities).
