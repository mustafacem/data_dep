Valuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses, representing a forward-looking estimate of future credit losses involving significant judgment. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting the loss in the event of default.

A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses.
