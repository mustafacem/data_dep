FISCAL 2023 6

Audit Committee concerned itself in fiscal 2023 – due to the regular, legally required external rotation of the independent auditors at the end of fiscal 2023 – with the selection and transition procedure for the audit of the financial statements for fiscal 2024.

The Supervisory Board members take part, on their own responsibility, in the educational and training measures necessary for the performance of their duties – measures relating, for example, to changes in the legal framework and to new, groundbreaking technologies. The Company supports them in this regard. Internal informational events are regularly offered to support targeted training measures. In March and July of fiscal 2023, three internal training events concerning strategically relevant tech- nology and sustainability-related topics were held for all Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory Board informed itself, in particular, about industrial and generative artificial intelligence and discussed the tech- nological background, application and impact on Siemens’ markets as well as the technology-related and regulatory challenges.
