B.3.1 Short-term variable compensation (Bonus)

B.3.1.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING

The Bonus system is based on three equally weighted target dimensions, which take account of the overall responsibility of the Managing Board as well as each Managing Board members’ specific business responsibilities and individual challenges:

→ “Siemens Group”

→ “Managing Board portfolio”

→ “Individual targets.”

Performance criteria are assigned to each of the three target dimensions based on Company priorities and the responsibilities of each Managing Board member. One financial performance criterion is assigned to the “Siemens Group” dimension and another to the “Managing Board portfolio” dimension. The fulfillment of these criteria is measured on the basis of key performance indicators. Within the “Individual targets” dimension, the financial performance criteria “growth” and “liquidity” can be employed as can additional, non-financial performance criteria. In the case of non-financial performance criteria, the Supervisory Board considers the degree to which a Managing Board member has fulfilled so-called focus topics, which comprise operations-related aspects of the execution of the Company’s strategy as well as sustainability- related aspects.
