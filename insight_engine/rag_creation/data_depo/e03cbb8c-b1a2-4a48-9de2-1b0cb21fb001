Transparency on greenhouse gas emissions We report our greenhouse gas emissions based on the

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol corporate standard. Direct greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from purchased electricity and district heating (Scope 2) are calculated for all sites. We also report our emissions in our upstream and downstream value chain (Scope 3), including emissions originating in our supply chains and the use of our products.
