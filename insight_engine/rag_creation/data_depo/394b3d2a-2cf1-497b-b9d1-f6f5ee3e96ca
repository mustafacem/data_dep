Fair value of equity instruments quoted in an active market is based on price quotations at period-end date. Fair value of debt instruments, is either based on prices provided by price service agencies or is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates.

Fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined in accordance with the specific type of instrument. Fair values of derivative interest rate contracts are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term of the instrument. Interest rate futures are valued based on quoted market prices, if available. Fair values of foreign currency derivatives are based on forward exchange rates. Options are generally valued based on quoted market prices or based on option pricing models. No compensating effects from underlying transactions (e.g. firm commitments and forecast transactions) are considered.
