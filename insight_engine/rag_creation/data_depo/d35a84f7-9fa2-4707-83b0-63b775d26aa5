Consolidated Financial Statements

values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.

The determination of the recoverable amount of a (group of) cash-generating unit(s) to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration of acquired entities, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on economic trends. In determining recoverable amounts, discounted cash flow calculations generally use five-year projections (in exceptional cases up to ten years) that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections consider past experience and represent managementâ€™s best estimate about future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. These estimates, including the methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.
