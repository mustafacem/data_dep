NOTE 19 Equity

As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Siemens’ issued capital is divided into 800 million and 850 million registered shares, respectively, with no par value and a notional value of €3.00 per share. The shares are paid in full. At the Shareholders’ Meeting, each share has one vote and accounts for the shareholders’ proportionate share in the Company’s net income. All shares confer the same rights and obligations. In fiscal 2023, Siemens cancelled 50 million treasury shares, thereby reducing issued capital by €150 million to €2.4 billion.
