SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATION

Climate change adaptation

We continuously evaluate the vulnerability of all Siemens locations regarding acute physical risks based on assess- ments provided by external suppliers and data collected internally. Through recurrent analyses conducted by Global Risk Consultants on behalf of TÜV Süd, it is evident that the Siemens locations significantly surpass industry standards in terms of risk protection as per the respective insurer ratings (industry average: approximately 70, Siemens: approxi- mately 80). Consequently, Siemens locations are consistently characterized by notably low risk levels. We continuously conduct local risk assessments and collaborate closely with various stakeholders to ensure an adequate protection level.
