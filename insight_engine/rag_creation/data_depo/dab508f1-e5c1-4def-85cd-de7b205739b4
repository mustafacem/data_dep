Credit guarantees cover the financial obligations of third parties generally in cases where Siemens is the vendor and (or) contractual partner or Siemens is liable for obligations of associated companies accounted for using the equity method. Additionally, credit guarantees are issued in the course of the SFS business. Credit guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or non-payment by the primary debtor, Siemens will be required to settle such financial obligations. The maximum amount of these guarantees is equal to the outstanding balance of the credit or, in case a credit line is subject to variable utilization, the nominal amount of the credit line. These guarantees have typically residual terms of up to three years (in fiscal 2022 four years). The Company held collateral mainly through inventories and trade receivables. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, Credit guarantees include €95 million and €123 million for which Siemens holds reimbursement rights towards Siemens Energy. Siemens accrued €18 million and €2 million relating to credit guarantees as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
