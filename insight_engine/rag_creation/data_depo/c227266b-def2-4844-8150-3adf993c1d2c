Our ICS and ERM are based on the globally accepted COSO framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission). Our ERM approach is based on the COSO Standard “Enterprise Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and Performance” (2017) and the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018) and is adapted to Siemens requirements. Our ICS is based on the internationally recognized “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” (2013) also developed by COSO. The framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the ICS. The frameworks connect the ERM process with our financial reporting process and our ICS, both systems are complementary.
