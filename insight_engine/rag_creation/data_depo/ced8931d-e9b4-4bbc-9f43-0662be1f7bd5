On a worldwide basis, growth in orders related to external customers came on a sharp increase at Mobility and clear order growth at Smart Infrastructure; both businesses reported higher order intake across all regions year-over-year. Digital Industries and, to a lesser extent, Siemens Healthineers recorded order declines from high bases of comparison. Siemens Healthineers again had the highest order contribution.

In the Europe, C.I.S., Africa, Middle East region, order intake increased by double digits at Mobility, including a €2.5 billion order for the first line of a turnkey rail system in Egypt and a €2.1 billion order for suburban trains in Germany. Smart Infrastructure recorded clear order growth, whereas Digital Industries showed a double-digit decline year-over-year from a high base of comparison, due to its automation businesses. Orders at Siemens Healthineers declined year-over-year primarily due to lower demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests in the diagnostics business. Within the region, Germany showed a pattern similar to the region overall.
