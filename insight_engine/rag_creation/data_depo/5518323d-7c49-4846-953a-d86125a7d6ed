Combined Management Report

Qualification of employees involved in the accounting process is ensured through appropriate selection processes and training. As a fundamental principle, based on materiality considerations, the “four eyes” principle applies, and specific procedures must be adhered to for data authorization. Additional control mechanisms include target-performance comparisons and analyses of the composition of and changes in individual line items, both in the closing data submitted by reporting units and in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In line with our information security requirements, accounting-related IT systems contain defined access rules protecting them from unauthorized access. The manual and system-based control mechanisms referred to above generally also apply when reconciling the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) closing data to the Annual Financial Statements of Siemens AG.
