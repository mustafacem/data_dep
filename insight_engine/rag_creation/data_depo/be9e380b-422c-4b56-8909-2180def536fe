¹ Based on the maximum amounts Siemens could be required to settle in the event of default by the primary debtor. ² A considerable portion result from asset-based lending transactions meaning that the respective loans can only be drawn after sufficient collateral has been provided by the borrower.

Credit risk

Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is failing to discharge its obligations in full and on time or if the value of collateral declines.

Siemens provides its customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing particularly in connection with large projects. Hence, credit risks are determined by the solvency of the debtors, the recoverability of the collaterals, the success of projects we invested in and the global economic development.
