“Individual targets” target dimension

The “Individual targets” target dimension comprises four equally weighted individual targets, achievement of each of which may be between 0% and 200%.

The cash conversion rate (CCR) was defined as the first individual target for all Managing Board members. The CCR reflects a company’s ability to convert profit into available cash. For the President and CEO and the Managing Board members with primarily functional responsibility, the CCR target was defined on the basis of the Siemens Group in order to support Siemens’ voluntary commitment to generate cash at Group level. CCR Siemens Group is defined as the ratio of free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to net income. For the Managing Board members with business responsibility for Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure, the CCR targets are business-specific and defined as the ratio of free cash flow to profit at each business. The target amounts for CCR were based on the budget plans.
