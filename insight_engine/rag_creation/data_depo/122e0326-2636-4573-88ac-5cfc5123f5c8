Siemens operates in an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, particularly due to the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Israel-Gaza/Middle East. Notably, we face continuing inflation, increased interest rates, volatile foreign currencies and share prices along with a rising apprehension of a slow-down of economic growth in significant markets compared to prior years. Uncertainties increase in prognosis and forecasts, in applying critical accounting estimates and in using management judgements. Those trends could impact fair values and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, amount and timing of results of operations and cash flows of Siemens. Severity and duration of those trends are decisive on the magnitude of its impact on Siemensâ€™ Consolidated Financial Statements. Siemens based its estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and best information available.
