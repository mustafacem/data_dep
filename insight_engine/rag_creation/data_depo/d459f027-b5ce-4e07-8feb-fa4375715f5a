Future Fund supports the transition to a new world of work Siemens AG and its Central Works Council intend to take a

proactive role in shaping structural change. Weâ€™re working together to create a learning organization that can master structural transformation as well as optimize the opportunities of change that will benefit our people. A Future Fund has been established to support development programs intended to help our people stay oriented in a disruptive employment environment. In particular, it enables them to qualify and learn beyond their previous limits. It finances projects related to structural change that go beyond site boundaries, with support from the site management and the Central Works Council.
