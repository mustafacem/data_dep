Infineon Update Doesn't Bode Well for Siemens Automation Businesses -- Market Talk

06 February 2024 13:09 CET

1209 GMT - German chip maker Infineon Technologies just provided the latest signal yet that the industrial-automation market got off to a slow start in 2024, which could weigh on Siemens's automation businesses, Citi analysts say in a research note. In results for its first fiscal quarter, Infineon mentioned increasing inventory adjustments by industrial customers and projected a revenue decline in its green industrial power division. The update from Infineon--a supplier to several industrial companies including Siemens, Schneider Electric, and ABB, according to Citi--comes after initial reports from automation companies this earnings season that led Citi to forecast the automation market could bottom out in the first half of 2024, Citi says. Siemens shares fall 0.5% to EUR163.84, while Infineon drops 3.6% to EUR33.42. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)
