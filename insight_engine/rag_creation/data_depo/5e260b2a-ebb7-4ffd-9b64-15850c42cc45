Independent Auditorâ€™s Reports (Group)

Revenues, total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a construction-type contract.

The effects of current geopolitical and macroeconomic developments on the project business, such as delays in project execution, price increases or disruptions in supply chains and their accounting treatment were taken into account during our audit.
