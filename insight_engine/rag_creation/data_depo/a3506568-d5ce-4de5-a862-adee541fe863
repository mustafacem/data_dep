Annual Financial Statements

Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at the balance sheet date. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the pension provision is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting to a present value.
