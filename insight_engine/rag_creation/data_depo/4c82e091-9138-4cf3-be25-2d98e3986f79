5.4 Occupational health and safety management

To support our people’s resilience, we have implemented key measures:

→ Managers and team members engage in ongoing commu- nication about health, safety, and well-being at work.

→ We have expanded the scope of learning and exchange opportunities, particularly regarding resilience, psycho- logical safety, and psychosocial risk management. In fiscal 2023, we added trainings on resilience and well-being to our new scalable Lead. Empower. Accelerate. Practice (L.E.A.P) learning program.
