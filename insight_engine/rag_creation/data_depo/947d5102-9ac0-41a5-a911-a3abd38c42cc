The final assessment of compliance with the maximum compensation for fiscal 2023 will be included in the Compensation Report for fiscal 2027.

B.2.3 Appropriateness of compensation

The Supervisory Board conducted the annual review of Managing Board compensation in order to determine the latter’s appropriateness and conformity with market conditions. For this purpose, the Supervisory Board assessed the compensation’s level and structure relative to the companies included in the DAX 40, the German blue-chip stock index, and relative to the companies included in the STOXX Europe 50 (horizontal comparison). In the course of its review, the Supervisory Board also assessed the development of Managing Board compensation relative to the compensation of Senior Management and Siemens’ total workforce in Germany (vertical comparison). Senior Management comprises executive employees. The total workforce comprises Senior Management as well as the Siemens employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements and those who are not. In addition to a status quo analysis, the vertical comparison took into account the development of compensation ratios over time. Since Siemens Healthineers is a separately managed, publicly listed company, its workforce was not included in the vertical comparison.
