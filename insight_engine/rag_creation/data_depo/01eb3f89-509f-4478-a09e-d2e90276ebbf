Decarbonization targets for our own operations Our Net Zero 2030 pledge We have expanded our ambitions beyond the scope of our

validated Science-Based Target and shortened our timeline for decarbonization: As part of our DEGREE sustainability framework (without Siemens Healthineers), we set a goal for all Siemens production facilities and buildings worldwide and our vehicle fleet to achieve a Net Zero1 carbon footprint by 2030. In effect, this means reducing CO2e Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Siemens’ business operations for Siemens without Siemens Healthineers (SHS) by 90% by 2030, compared to 2019. To achieve this target, Siemens has pledged to invest an additional €650 million in its own decarbonization efforts by 2030. Any residual emissions will then be balanced with high-quality carbon offsets that meet established standards.
