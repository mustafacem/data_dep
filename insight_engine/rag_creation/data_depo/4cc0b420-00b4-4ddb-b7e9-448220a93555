Mobility’s R&D strategy is focused on reducing life-cycle costs of rail infrastructure and rolling stock, securing system availability, increasing network capacity of rail infrastructure, optimizing the processes of rail operators and improving passenger experience. With Siemens Xcelerator, Mobility intends to make software more modular and increasingly move it to the cloud. At the same time, Mobility intends to enhance connectivity of hardware and software and provide open application programming interfaces. Thereby Mobility accelerates the pace and impact of digital innovation, which in turn benefits owners, operators, and customers of rail transport. Mobility’s major R&D areas include the development of efficient vehicle platforms with optimized lifecycle cost; eco-friendly, alternative power supplies for trains; the Railigent X open application suite for maintenance of rail assets; smart connected products; the Distributed Smart Safe System (DS3), which allows for hardware-independent and cloud-enabled signaling; automatic train operation for European Train Control System (ETCS); safe artificial intelligence for driverless trains; air-free brake systems, 5G for wireless-based activities; the Mobility Software Suite X for operators and passengers; and cyber security. Mobility’s investments focus mainly on maintaining or enhancing its production facilities, on meeting project demands, and on enhancing its depot services.
