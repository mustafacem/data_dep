An exposure is considered defaulted if the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations. A range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, receivables being more than 90 days past due, or a default rating by an external rating agency.

To analyze and monitor credit risks, the Company applies various systems and processes. A main element is a central IT application that processes data from operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate, which may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. Additionally, qualitative information is considered to particularly incorporate the latest developments.
