We employ a range of systems and meticulously compare the parameters acquired from Swiss RE (RDS), Zurich Resilience Solutions (ZRS), Verizon Maplecroft, among others.

In fiscal 2023, we conducted the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) assessment with regards to future physical climate risks in the context of our reporting under the EU Taxonomy regulation for all activities related to the environmental objective “Climate Change Mitigation”. The assessment of physical climate-related risks of all eligible and substantially contributing activities was conducted by technical experts on site, supplier, and project type levels. We partnered with insurers and other external risk data providers to assess future hazards associated with climate change, e.g. cyclone, hurricane, typhoon, heavy precipitation, or wildfire, using the IPCC scenario RCP 4.5. Additionally, we defined and started to implement measures at locations where signifi- cant risks have been identified.
