As previously reported, in June 2015, Siemens Ltda. appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of a previous court to suspend Siemens Ltda. from participating in public tenders and signing contracts with public administrations in Brazil for a five year term based on alleged irregularities in calendar 1999 and 2004 in public tenders with the Brazilian Postal authority. In June 2018, the court accepted Siemens’ appeal and declared the earlier instance decision as void. In June 2021, the court referred the case back to the court of first instance. In February 2018, the Ministério Público in Brasilia filed a lawsuit based on the same set of facts, mainly claiming the exclusion of Siemens Ltda. from public tenders for a ten year term. Siemens Ltda. is defending itself against the lawsuit. Siemens Ltda. is currently not excluded from participating in public tenders.
