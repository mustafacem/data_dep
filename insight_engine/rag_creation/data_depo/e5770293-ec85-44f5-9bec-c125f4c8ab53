10.2 Restrictions on voting rights or transfer of shares

At the Shareholders’ Meeting, each share of stock has one vote and accounts for the shareholder’s proportionate share in the Company’s net income. An exception to this rule applies with regard to treasury shares held by the Company, which do not entitle the Company to any rights. Under Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act the voting right of the affected shares is excluded by law.

Siemens shares issued to employees worldwide under the Siemens share programs implemented since the beginning of fiscal 2009, in particular the Share Matching Plan, are freely transferable unless applicable local laws indicate otherwise. Under the rules of the Share Matching Plan, however, in order to receive one matching share free of charge for each three shares purchased, participants are required to hold the shares purchased by them for a vesting period of several years, during which the participants must be continuously employed by Siemens AG or any of its affiliated companies. The right to receive matching shares is forfeited if the purchased shares are sold, transferred, hedged on, pledged or hypothecated in any way during the relevant vesting period.
