Downside scenario

We could lower the rating on Siemens if its credit metrics fall below our expectations, such that FFO to debt declines below 45% and its EBITDA margin structurally falls below 17%.

We could also lower the rating if:

- Siemens' FOCF generation does not materialize as expected--for example, if the economy falls back into a prolonged recession, leading to a notable decline in order intake, or if development in the group's highest-margin divisions, SHS and DI, lags our expectations.
