We strive to train every employee worldwide on the BCGs in a recurring three-year cycle, according to the Ethics DEGREE target. The new three-year cycle started in fiscal 2023. In July 2023, the rollout of an update to our BCG web-based training began, which now includes our Ethical Principles. Our learning management system SABA tracks the mandatory training courses. The completion of training requirements is visible in our SABA dashboard, and detail reporting is available for the management on demand.
