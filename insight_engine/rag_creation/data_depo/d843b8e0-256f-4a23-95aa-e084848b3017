In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we above all analyzed management’s assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income and compared them to internal business plans. In the course of our audit procedures regarding deferred tax liabilities, we examined in particular the assumptions regarding reinvestment of subsidiaries’ retained profits for an indefinite period and assessed these taking into account dividend planning.

Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes.
