Applying our own technologies in our own operations is key to achieving these ambitions. In Nanjing, China, for example, we consolidated three production sites into one lean and green digital native factory, which was first built as a digital twin. This led to annual savings of 5,000,000 kWh of energy, 3,300 metric tons of CO2, and 6,000 m3 of water. At the same time, productivity went up by 20%. For Siemens, rethinking scalable products and services for a sustainable world should go hand in hand with savings, efficiency gains, and customer value.
