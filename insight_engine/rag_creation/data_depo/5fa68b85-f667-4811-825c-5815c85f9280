Managing Board members in office on September 30, 2023

The base salary and the BSAV contribution (or the amount for free disposal) are fixed amounts. In no case did the fringe benefits awarded to a Managing Board member exceed the maximum amount defined for fiscal 2023. The Bonus cap was not reached in fiscal 2023.

Since the 2023 Stock Awards tranche is not due until November 2026, compliance with the maximum limit of the Stock Awards for fiscal 2023 can be finally assessed only in November 2026, when the 2023 Stock Awards tranche is settled.
