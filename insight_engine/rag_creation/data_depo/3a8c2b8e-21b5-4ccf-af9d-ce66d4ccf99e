Net income nearly doubled year-over year to a historic high of €8.5 billion and corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled to €10.04. Earnings per share before purchase price allocation (EPS pre PPA) increased to €10.77.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) for fiscal 2023 rose to 18.6%, up from 10.0% in fiscal 2022. This increase was due to sharply higher income before interest after tax year-over-year. We thus exceeded the forecast for ROCE, which was to come close to or reach the lower end of our target range of 15% to 20%.
