Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net realizable value, costs being generally determined based on an average or first-in, first-out method. Determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity, technical and price risks.

Defined benefit plans – Siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO)), the expected rates of salary and pension increases are considered. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. Significant plans apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the preceding fiscal year’s period-end date.
