electricity, we follow the purchasing guidelines of the WWF’s Next Generation Green Electricity initiative.

Siemens has also entered power purchasing agreements (PPA) to support our supply with renewable electricity. For instance, in Kalwa, India, we joined a joint venture that produces renewable electricity using photovoltaic systems. Another PPA with Enovos Energie Deutschland in Germany’s South Eifel region will consist of a total of 11 photovoltaic systems (currently under construction) with a total capacity of about 200 GWh a year. Südeifel GmbH & Co KG is respon- sible for the planning, construction, and operation of the systems and for marketing the renewable electricity. Siemens will purchase 39.1 GWh of electricity per year beginning in January of 2024.
