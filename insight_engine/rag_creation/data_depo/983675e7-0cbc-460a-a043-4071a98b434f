Outlook

We confirm our outlook for fiscal 2024. We continue to assume that geopolitical tensions do not further increase. Under this condition, we expect our Industrial Business to continue its profitable growth.

For the Siemens Group we expect comparable revenue growth, net of currency translation and portfolio effects, in the range of 4% to 8% and a book-to-bill ratio above 1.

Digital Industries expects for fiscal 2024 comparable revenue development of 0% to 3%. This is based on the assumption that following destocking by customers, global demand in the automation businesses, especially in China, will pick up again in the second half of the fiscal year. The profit margin is expected to be 20% to 23%.
