Lastly, we drive environmental awareness with our Business Conduct Guidelines and Supplier Code of Conduct, which include environmental protection requirements. SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PRACTICES COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS

Targets We strive to go beyond legal requirements by managing the

environmental impact of our business activities throughout the value chain. We are also aiming to increase our align- ment with economic, ecological, and social requirements. This helps us to increase our customers’ competitiveness, while simultaneously supporting the environmental compat- ibility of our business. In collaboration with our business partners, we plan to steadily reduce the environmental impact of our products, systems, solutions, and services. We do this by creating options for repair, reuse, recycling, and refurbishment and by minimizing our own use or consumption of energy, materials, and supplies – while also minimizing emissions.
