The contribution of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. led to a decrease of provisions for pensions and similar obligations. Additional major effects resulted from returns on plan assets and actuarial gains and losses. For further information see Note 17 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for fiscal 2023.

The main factors for the decrease in total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG were a negative other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, of €4.0 billion resulting mainly from currency translation; dividend payments of €3.4 billion (for fiscal 2022); and changes in equity totaling €1.6 billion resulting from an equity transaction at Siemens Energy AG. These factors were largely offset by €7.9 billion in net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG. In fiscal 2023, Siemens cancelled 50 million treasury shares, thereby reducing issued capital by €150 million and retained earnings by €5.1 billion.
