Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk results from the Companyâ€™s inability to meet its financial liabilities. Siemens follows a deliberated financing policy that is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio, a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. Siemens mitigates liquidity risk by the implementation of effective working capital and cash management, arranged credit facilities with highly rated financial institutions, via a debt issuance program and via a global multi-currency commercial paper program. Liquidity risk may also be mitigated by the Siemens Bank GmbH, which increases the flexibility of depositing cash or refinancing.
