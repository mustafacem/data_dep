B.2.2 Maximum compensation

The maximum compensation of each Managing Board member is determined annually by the Supervisory Board in accordance with Section 87a para. 1 sent. 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Maximum compensation is equal to the total of the maximum amounts of all compensation components that can possibly be paid out to each Managing Board member for the relevant fiscal year. It is calculated by adding base salary, maximum fringe benefits and the BSAV contribution (or the amount for free disposal) as well as two times the Bonus target amount and three times the Stock Awards target amount. Twice the Bonus target amount and triple the Stock Awards target amount also correspond to the respective limits (individual caps) on the amount of variable compensation.
