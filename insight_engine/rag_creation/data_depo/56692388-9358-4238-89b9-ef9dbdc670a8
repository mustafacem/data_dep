As a leading technology company, Siemens supports cus- tomers all over the world to become more competitive, resilient, and, above all, more sustainable. Our portfolio enables a positive impact on our planet and society at scale. Today, it is about more than just managing negative foot- prints; it is about a company’s handprint and increasingly expanding businesses’ net-positive impact on the world. That is why Siemens has integrated its sustainability strategy in our business activities, technology roadmap, investment decisions, own operations, and governance. We empower our customers to accelerate their sustainability goals along three impact areas: decarbonization & energy efficiency, resource efficiency & circularity, people centricity & societal impact.
