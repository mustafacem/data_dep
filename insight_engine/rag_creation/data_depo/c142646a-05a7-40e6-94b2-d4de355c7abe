An approximately four-year vesting period begins with the allocation of Stock Awards, after the expiration of which Siemens shares are transferred. The beneficiary Managing Board members are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period.

Performance criteria

Since fiscal 2020, the number of Siemens shares that is actually transferred depends 80% on the financial performance criterion “long-term value creation,” measured on the basis of the key performance indicator “total shareholder return” (TSR), and 20% on the non-financial performance criterion “sustainability.” For measuring the “sustainability” performance criterion, Siemens AG’s performance in the environment, social and governance (ESG) area is assessed on the basis of a Siemens-internal ESG/Sustainability index, the composition of which is determined annually by the Supervisory Board.
