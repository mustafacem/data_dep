The remaining foreign currency risk after offsetting cash flows in the same currency is hedged by the Corporate Treasury with external contract partners. The net foreign currency position (before hedging) is combined with the offsetting foreign currency exchange contracts to a macro valuation unit. For this purpose, hedged items and hedging instruments are measured with the respective underlying discounted cash flows. For foreign currency derivative financial instruments, the determination is based on the changes in relevant forward exchange rates. The existing derivative currency hedging contracts are included in the valuation unit in their entirety and had maturity terms until the year 2041. The cash in- and outflows from the foreign currency exchange contracts, firm commitments and forecast transactions are disclosed on a net basis in the following table.
