Smart Infrastructureâ€™s customer and end user base is diverse. It encompasses infrastructure developers, construction companies and contractors; owners, operators and tenants of both public and commercial buildings including hospitals, campuses, airports and data centers; companies in process industries such as oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and chemicals; companies in discrete manufacturing industries such as automotive and machine building; and utilities and power grid network operators (transmission and distribution). Smart Infrastructure serves its customers through a broad range of channels, including direct sales organizations, distributors and partners such as panel builders, original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers and installers. To address more complex customer requirements, Smart Infrastructure uses its dedicated sales forces within its country organization. Furthermore, Smart Infrastructure provides e-commerce platforms or marketplaces where customers can directly place orders on-line, either via a web shop or via electronic interfaces, and sells its broad range of digital offerings and connected devices via Siemens Xcelerator. These digital sales channels and e- commerce platforms are becoming increasingly important and Smart Infrastructure therefore is continuously strengthening its digital omni-channel marketing and e-commerce platforms.
