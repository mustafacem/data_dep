SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 128

7.2 Reporting principles for Customer Avoided Emissions

Accounting for Customer Avoided Emissions All Siemens Businesses and SFS are required to report the

Customer Avoided Emissions for all products, systems, solu- tions, services, or investments that lead to the avoidance of GHG emissions during the customer use phase.

Customer Avoided Emissions represent the difference between the GHG emissions of a Siemens offering and the GHG emissions of a baseline or reference scenario. Siemens Businesses and SFS must account for and report the annual Customer Avoided Emissions from the use of Siemens offer- ings sold or investments made in the reporting year over the entire duration of their use phase (“future impact of today’s revenue” similar to Scope 3 use phase emissions according to the GHG Protocol Standard).
