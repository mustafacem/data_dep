Our ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of, and response regarding, risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typically three years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective measures and controls. If risks have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial statements (e.g. as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entityâ€™s business objectives. As a consequence, only additional risks arising from the same cause (e.g. deviations from business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be considered. In order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle; we complement this periodic reporting with an ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and opportunities are evaluated in terms of impact and likelihood, considering different impact perspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory requirements. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective managements of our organizational units. The top-down element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process, if found to be relevant. Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above.
