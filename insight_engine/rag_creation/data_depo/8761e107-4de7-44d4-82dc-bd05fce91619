Decisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly, Profit primarily includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only, while all other regularly recurring pension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item Centrally carried pension expense.

Amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations are not part of Profit. Furthermore, income taxes are excluded from Profit since income tax is subject to legal structures, which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. The effect of certain litigation and compliance issues is excluded from Profit, if such items are not indicative of performance. This may also be the case for items that refer to more than one reportable segment, SRE and (or) POC or have a corporate or central character. Costs for support functions are primarily allocated to the segments.
