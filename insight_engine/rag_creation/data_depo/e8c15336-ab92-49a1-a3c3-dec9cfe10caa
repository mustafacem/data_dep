Our contribution to sustainable development of societies

– Effective influence in achieving UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

– SDGs included in our DEGREE sustainability framework

The United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their 169 targets serve as a compass for the change efforts that must be made by governments, busi- nesses, cities, and civil society as a whole if we are to achieve a more sustainable future. The SDGs and their associated targets address the most important economic, social, envi- ronmental, and governance-related challenges of our times, and therefore they help stimulate transformational change. At Siemens we have adopted them as values, and so the SDGs also influence us as a company.
