On September 18, 2019, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG resolved that the contracts with members of the Managing Board should not contain such right of termination in the future. This has already been taken into account in the case of contract extensions and in the case of new contracts with the newly appointed members of the Managing Board as of October 1, 2020.
