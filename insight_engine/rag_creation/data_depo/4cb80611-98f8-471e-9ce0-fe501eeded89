Germany

In Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), frozen legacy plans as well as deferred compensation plans. The majority of active employees participate in the BSAV. Those benefits are based predominantly on notional contributions and the return on the corresponding assets of this plan, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. At inception of the BSAV, benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. However, the frozen plans still expose Siemens to investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and longevity risk. The pension plans are funded via contractual trust arrangements (CTA). In Germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply.
