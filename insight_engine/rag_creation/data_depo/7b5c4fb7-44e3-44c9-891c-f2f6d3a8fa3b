RED measures The RED approach is designed to identify potential measures

for improving the environmental impacts of our products, systems, solutions, and services, for example, to:

→ Improve product resource efficiency by reducing material inputs or replacing physical components and functions with digital solutions, otherwise known as dematerialization

→ Optimize product energy efficiency by minimizing energy consumption during use and designing environmentally sound operation modes

→ Enhance product durability and reliability by selecting materials that help extend a product’s lifespan and main- tain its functionality
