The increase in short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt was due mainly to reclassifications of long-term instruments totaling €5.3 billion. This was partly offset by the repayment of euro, U.S. dollar and British pound instruments totaling €4.6 billion.

Long-term debt decreased due primarily to the above-mentioned reclassifications and currency translation effects of €1.9 billion on bonds issued in the U.S. dollar and British pound. Set against this were mainly increases of €2.5 billion from the issuance of euro bonds.
