Total shareholder return – TSR is indicative of the performance of one share over a specified period of time – in the case of Siemens, over the approximately four-year vesting period. It takes into account changes in the share price and the dividends paid during this period. To reflect the Company’s international footprint, the TSR of Siemens AG is compared at the end of the vesting period with the TSR of an international sector index, the MSCI World Industrials or a comparable successor index.

Target achievement for TSR is concretely determined by first calculating a TSR reference value for Siemens AG and a TSR reference value for the sector index. The TSR reference value is equal to the average of the end-of-month values over the first 12 months of the vesting period (reference period).
