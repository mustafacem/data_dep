Siemens's mobility unit has won an order worth about 500 million euros ($543.7 million) to deliver Mireo trains to Leipzig, Germany, and the surrounding region.

The German industrial group said the order is for 75 Mireo trains, including 41 three-car Mireo trains, four-car Mireo trains as well as 16 two-car battery-powered Mireo Plus B trains. The trains are expected to start operations in December 2026, Siemens said.

"It is our largest Mireo order to date," said Gerhard Greiter, Chief Executive for North East and Eastern Europe at Siemens Mobility.
