We seek to work profitably and as efficiently as possible with the capital provided by our shareholders and lenders. For purposes of managing and controlling our capital efficiency, we use return on capital employed, or ROCE, as our primary measure in our Siemens Financial Framework. Our goal is to achieve a ROCE within a range of 15% to 20% over a cycle of three to five years.
