SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 141

We establish water targets at multiple sites to account for the specific local environment and to drive effective mitiga- tion measures. At the corporate level, we have implemented a defined water strategy, and have conducted risk assess- ments to shape local water targets.

The aim of our water strategy is to minimize the adverse local effects of our water consumption and use. In fiscal 2022, we expanded the analysis of our water-related risks to include our supply chain. Based on this analysis, we derived further measures for sustainable water use.
