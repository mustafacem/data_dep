Siemens and its employees supported Siemens Stiftung’s projects with a number of donation campaigns during the fiscal year. One example is the COVID-19 Aid Fund, which supported the “STEM Education for Innovation” initiative launched by Siemens Stiftung to advance innovative educa- tion formats in Latin American countries. To date it has spent €0.75 million on projects that included producing 467 digital and analog instructional media for the entire educational chain and providing more training for more than 245,000 STEM teachers and other interested participants in more than 300 trainings, workshops, and webinars. The fund also supported the creation of a multi-stakeholder network that promotes STEMplus education in 14 mainly Latin American countries as well as the education portal “CREA” (Centro de Recursos Educativos Abiertos), which offers more than 1,700 open educational resources for STEM lessons.
