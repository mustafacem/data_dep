SIEMENS SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2023 35

3.1 Compliance and ethics

Siemens offers a range of reporting channels to enable all employees and outside third parties to flag potential compli- ance violations to the company. For instance, complaints can be reported by way of the protected whistle-blower system “Tell Us” or to the independent Siemens Ombudsperson. Reports received through these channels are forwarded to our Compliance organization. Complaints can also be reported directly to the Compliance Officers in our business units or to the senior management. Whistle-blowers at Siemens are protected by national laws and also by internal company regulations that prohibit the punishment or other detrimental treatment of anyone who reports a suspicious activity in good faith.
