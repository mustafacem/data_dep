We slightly increased the number of external sustainability audits compared to fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, the figure rose by about 13% to 481 audits. This figure includes 13 audits that we conducted virtually, where the auditor inspected the suppliers’ facilities by remote video. Also included are four audits verified by our audit service provider that were conducted on behalf of third parties at companies that also have supplier relationships with Siemens. These audit reports fully comply with Siemens’ requirements and were provided to us with the approval of the audited companies.
