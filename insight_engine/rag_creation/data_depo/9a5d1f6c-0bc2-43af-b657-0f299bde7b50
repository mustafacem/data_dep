Combined Management Report

Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal 2023 was €10.0 billion, reaching a record high. The cash conversion rate for Siemens, defined as the ratio of Free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations to Net income, was 1.17. We thus achieved a cash conversion rate that contributed strongly to the average required to reach our target of 1 minus annual comparable revenue growth rate over a cycle of three to five years.

We intend to continue providing an attractive shareholder return. The Siemens Managing Board, in agreement with the Supervisory Board, proposes a dividend of €4.70 per share, up from €4.25 per share a year earlier.
