The result for Siemens Energy Investment was driven by a gain of €1.6 billion from a partial reversal of an impairment on Siemens' stake in Siemens Energy AG (fiscal 2022 included an impairment of €2.7 billion), a gain of €0.3 billion resulting from the transfer of a stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V., and a gain of €0.2 billion which was recorded in connection with a capital increase by Siemens Energy AG in which Siemens did not participate. These gains were partly offset by Siemens’ share of Siemens Energy’s after-tax loss and expenses from amortization of assets resulting from purchase price allocation totaling €1.5 billion (fiscal 2022: totaling €0.2 billion).
