→ Connectivity & Edge: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the result of the increasing networking of field devices. The IIoT enables field devices to be equipped with additional software-based functions during ongoing operations and makes it possible for the data generated by these devices to be evaluated in the field or in the cloud.

→ Simulation & Digital Twin: Digital twins are the result of modeling and simulating systems and processes, including the development and manufacturing of products. Digital twins make it easier to accelerate the commissioning of manufacturing plants, speed up time-to-market, and improve the operation of infrastructures throughout their lifecycles.
