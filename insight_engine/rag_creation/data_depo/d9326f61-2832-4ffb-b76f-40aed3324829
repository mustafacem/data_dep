Siemens Financial Services in fiscal 2023 recorded higher earnings before taxes in the debt business despite a volatile credit environment. In the prior period, earnings before taxes were burdened by â‚¬0.2 billion in connection with the sale of the financing and leasing business in Russia at the end of the fiscal year. The equity business recorded strong results. While both periods under review included gains from the sales of equity investments, fiscal 2022 additionally included higher gains from fair value measurements of investments and gains from energy-related investments in connection with rising prices in global energy markets.
