Our commitment to Human Rights is anchored in our Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs) and global Human Rights policy. We do not tolerate discrimination, sexual or any other form of harassment, or inappropriate behavior toward individuals or groups. The guidelines clearly state:

→ “We respect the personal dignity, privacy, and rights of each individual. We believe diversity enriches our work- place. We work together without regard to ethnic origin, culture, religion, age, disability, skin color, gender, sexual identity and orientation, or world view.”
