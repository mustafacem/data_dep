Earnings Release Q1 FY 2024 | Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure, Mobility

• Order intake for Digital Industries came in substantially lower due primarily to the automation businesses as market conditions softened year-over-year and customers continued destocking following former proactive purchasing; orders in the software business came in lower compared to Q1 FY 2023, which included larger contract wins in the product lifecycle management (PLM) business

• Higher revenue in the software business, driven by the PLM business, was more than offset by revenue declines in the automation businesses particularly for higher-margin products
