• Siemens transferred a 8.0% stake in Siemens Energy AG to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. and no longer has significant influence over Siemens Energy AG. As a result, Siemens has ceased accounting for Siemens Energy under the equity method. The remaining 17.1% stake is reported as financial asset measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The share transfer and termination of equity method accounting resulted in a gain of €0.5 billion for Siemens Energy Investment.

• Within Financing, eliminations and other items, revaluation of the stake in Thoughtworks Holding, Inc. resulted in a gain in contrast to a loss in Q1 FY 2023, which also included burdens totaling €74 million related to provisions for a legacy project
