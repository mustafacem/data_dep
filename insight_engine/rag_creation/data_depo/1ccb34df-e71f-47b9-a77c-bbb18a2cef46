The majority of the Companyâ€™s provisions are generally expected to result in cash outflows during the next five years.

Warranties mainly relate to products sold. Order related losses and risks are provided for anticipated losses and risks on uncompleted construction, sales and leasing contracts.

The Company is subject to asset retirement obligations related to certain items of property, plant and equipment. Such asset retirement obligations are primarily attributable to environmental clean-up costs and to costs primarily associated with the removal of leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term.
