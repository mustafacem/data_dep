We further considered alleged or substantiated non-compliance with legal provisions, official regulations (including sanctions) and internal company policies by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters, obtaining written statements from external legal advisors, and by inquiring of the compliance organization. In this regard, among other procedures, we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses, and assessed on this basis whether managementâ€™s evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the annual financial statements is plausible.
