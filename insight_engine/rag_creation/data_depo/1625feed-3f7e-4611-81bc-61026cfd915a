Siemens Professional Education (SPE) coordinates and manages our international apprenticeships and dual-study programs to support ongoing talent development.

Our comprehensive learning portfolio enables us to continu- ally expand and evolve our people’s core competencies. We aim to support our people in successfully managing transi- tion and change while simultaneously enhancing Siemens’ agility and resilience. Today’s talent recruitment needs to satisfy an increasing need for digital and technical expertise. As the pace of technological development and digitalization reduces the half-life of expertise, continuous learning and upskilling is fundamental to Siemens’ continuing success.
