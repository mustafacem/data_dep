Legal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly, considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period, whether it is probable that such a Legal Proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. Due to new developments, it may be necessary, to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision. Upon resolution of a Legal Proceeding, Siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemensâ€™ financial position, its results of operations and/or its cash flows.
