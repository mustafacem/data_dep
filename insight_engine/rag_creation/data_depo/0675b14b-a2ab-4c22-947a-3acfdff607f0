Progress on DEGREE ambition #1: Net Zero operations by 2030, with 55% emissions reduction by 2025 and 90% by 2030

Compared to fiscal 2022, we reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2023 by 32 thousand metric tons of CO2e or 8%. We reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by a total of 50% since fiscal 2019. This reduction is primarily due to the rigorous imple- mentation of a number of measures and initiatives, which are briefly described below.

RE100: 80% renewable electricity for Siemens EV100: 11% electric vehicles at Siemens EP100: There are currently 33 Siemens sites with no net CO2e emissions during regular operations
