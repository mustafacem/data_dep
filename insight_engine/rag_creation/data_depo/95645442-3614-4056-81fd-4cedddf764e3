The main trends driving Mobilityâ€™s markets are urbanization, decarbonization and digitalization. Increasing populations in urban centers need daily mobility that is simpler, faster, and more flexible, reliable and affordable. At the same time, cities and national economies face the challenge of cutting CO2 and noise emissions and reducing space requirements and costs of transportation. The pressure on mobility providers to meet all these needs is expected to rise continuously. Furthermore, improving availability, connectivity, and sustainability of rail infrastructures increasingly requires digital solutions, which generates growth opportunities for providers of such solutions. IoT systems and new software-based solutions such as MaaS are expected to become major growth enablers for the rail industry. Overall trends towards urbanization, decarbonization and digitalization persist and many countries have been allocating significant funds to rail and public transport operators to address these trends.
