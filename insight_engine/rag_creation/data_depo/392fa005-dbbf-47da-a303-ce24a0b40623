The PSS initiative is managed by the PSS Maturity model, a proprietary, standards-based model. It shows the extent to which the established business and design processes are being expanded and constantly improved in terms of their security activities and requirements. Evaluations are per- formed annually at the organizational level, the results are discussed with each unit’s management team, and corre- sponding improvement programs are initiated.

To further strengthen Siemens’ cybersecurity business, our businesses offer selected high-maturity security services to external customers in collaboration with the Corporate Cybersecurity department.
