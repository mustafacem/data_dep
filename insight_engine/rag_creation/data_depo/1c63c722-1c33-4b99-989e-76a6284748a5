Research Update: Siemens AG Upgraded To &#39;AA-&#39; On Successful Portfolio Transformation And Conservative Financial Policy; Outlook Stable

Siemens' track record of very strong credit metrics and a conservative financial policy support the upgrade. The conservative financial policy aims to maintain a reported net debt to EBITDA ratio of up to 1.5x (by Siemens' definition), which fits well with S&P Global Ratings-adjusted FFO to debt of more than 45%, where the company usually maintains large headroom with FFO to debt of more than 60%. Over the past two decades, FFO to debt was only below 45% during the financial crisis of 2008, and below 60% in 2020 and 2021, due to the effects of the spin-off of Siemens Energy, the Varian acquisition, and the pandemic. We understand that management remains committed to its conservative financial policy, with its leverage target acting as a ceiling meaning it builds headroom before executing larger acquisitions. As well, we expect shareholder remunerations, in particular buybacks, will be carefully matched with FOCF to ensure achieving an FFO to debt ratio of comfortably above 45% over the next 24 months.
