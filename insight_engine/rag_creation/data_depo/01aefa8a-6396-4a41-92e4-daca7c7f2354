Protectionism (including tariffs/trade war): Protectionist trade policies, de-coupling and changes in the political and regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate, such as import and export controls, tariffs and other trade barriers including debarment from certain markets, inbound and outbound investment screenings, and price or exchange controls, could affect our business in national markets and could impact our business situation, financial position and results of operations; we may also be exposed to penalties, other sanctions and reputational damage. In addition, the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to adjusting our compliance programs.
