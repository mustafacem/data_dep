Mergers, acquisitions, equity investments, partnerships, divestments and streamlining our portfolio: We constantly monitor our current and potential markets to identify opportunities for strategic mergers, acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships, which may complement our organic growth. Such activities may help us to strengthen our position in our existing markets, provide access to new or underserved markets, or complement our technological portfolio in strategic areas. Opportunities might also arise when portfolio optimization measures generate gains, which enable us to further pursue our other strategies for growth and profitability.
