Starting with the 2019 tranche, the settlement of Stock Awards will be entirely by share transfer. For this reason, the number of Stock Awards, as set out in the table, is based on a target achievement of 200%. At the end of the vesting period, a final number of Siemens shares to be transferred will be determined on the basis of actual target achievement and taking into account the Stock Awards cap.

The target achievement of the Stock Awards from the 2019 tranche, which were due and settled in fiscal 2023, was 91%. Since the Stock Awards were initially allocated on the basis of 200% target achievement, a number equivalent to this shortfall was forfeited without refund or replacement, in accordance with plan requirements.
