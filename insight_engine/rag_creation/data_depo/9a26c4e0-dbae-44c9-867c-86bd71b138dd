Given the importance of cybersecurity for the senior man- agement, the Global Chief Cybersecurity Officer reports directly to the responsible member of the Managing Board, quarterly to the entire Managing Board, and annually to the Supervisory Board.

The CSB provides a collaborative platform for advancing strategic initiatives that address security issues and establish cybersecurity requirements and recommendations through- out Siemens and its affiliated companies. In addition, a collaboration agreement enables the Chief Cybersecurity Officer at Siemens Healthineers to participate in the CSB.
