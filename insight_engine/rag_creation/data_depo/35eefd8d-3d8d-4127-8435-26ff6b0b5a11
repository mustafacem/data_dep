7.4 Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

To make our portfolioâ€™s contribution to decarbonization more transparent, we report the amount of CO2e emissions that our products and solutions avoid compared to reference solutions. Customer avoided emissions represent the differ- ence between the CO2e emissions of a Siemens offering and the CO2e emissions of a baseline or reference scenario. In fiscal 2023, we helped our customers avoid 190 million metric tons of CO2e emissions. The Siemens technologies that make the largest contribution to the avoidance of CO2e emissions at our customers are frequency converters, railbound passenger and freight transportation, and building systems. For a detailed description of our methodology for calculating customer avoided emissions, please see REPORTING PRINCIPLES FOR CUSTOMER AVOIDED EMISSIONS, CLIMATE ACTION
