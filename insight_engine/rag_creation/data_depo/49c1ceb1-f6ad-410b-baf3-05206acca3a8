Risk-aware handling of declarable substances Another essential aspect of product stewardship is the

responsible handling of substances that are potentially haz- ardous for the environment or health, like those regulated by the EU REACH regulation. We modify internal IT procedures and material compliance processes with the aim of making the use of these substances safer. We are also working pro- actively to substitute and reduce them wherever we can. We work to continuously increase the utilization of the digital industrial substance database BOMcheck by our suppliers. We comply fully with the declaration requirements of inter- national legislation and IEC 62474, and we are constantly optimizing our interfaces and automated workflows.
