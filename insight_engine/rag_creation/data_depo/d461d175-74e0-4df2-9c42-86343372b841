Environmental, health & safety and other governmental regulations: Some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. Current and future environmental, health, safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs. Furthermore, we see the risk of potential environmental, health or safety incidents as well as potential non-compliance with environmental, health or safety regulations affecting Siemens and our contractors or sub-suppliers, resulting for example in serious injuries, business interruptions, penalties, loss of reputation and internal or external investigations.
