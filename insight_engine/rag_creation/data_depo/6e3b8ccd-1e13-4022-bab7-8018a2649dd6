and risks. Our decarbonization target, which is approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative, is aligned with the 1.5°C target and therefore the Paris Agreement.

As described in our STRATEGY chapter, there are several megatrends that are driving us to rethink established ways of doing things. These megatrends and their impacts are reshaping the needs of our customers and markets. To create a holistic picture of potential futures, we execute sustainabil- ity scenario analyses that enable us to map impacts and risks, identify opportunities, and find new ways to create value through pathways by 2030 and 2040. Strategic insights are derived from scientific frameworks like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Repre- sentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socio- economic Pathways (SSPs) as well as market trends and expert knowledge. The sustainability scenarios illustrate different possible development pathways for the global economy and Siemens’ operating environment, across the focus topics climate, circularity, biodiversity, and society that take into account both an organized 1.5°C and a disorganized 3°C pathway. These scenarios guide the development of our
