Auditor’s response: As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group’s internally established methods, processes and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of construction-type contracts. In this regard, we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the accounting-related internal controls in the project business by obtaining an understanding of business transactions specific to construction-type contracts, from the initiation of the transaction through presentation in the consolidated financial statements. We also tested controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates, the timely and complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation as well as their accounting treatment.
