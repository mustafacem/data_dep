4.3 Product stewardship

Expanding our use of secondary materials We want to proportionately increase our procurement of

secondary metal and resins by 2030. To achieve this, we are concentrating on suppliers of raw materials and semifinished products that can be directly influenced by our purchasing specifications.

Limiting declarable substances At the same time, we want to continuously reduce declarable

substances in all our products. Measurements and more details can be found in the section “Actions and results.”
