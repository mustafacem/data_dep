Combining the real and digital worlds Our strategy is to combine the real and digital worlds –

harnessing the power of hardware and software, or OT and IT. More than 90% of Siemens AG’s business enables positive sustainability outcomes for our customers. Worth highlight- ing is that our products sold to customers in fiscal 2023 will, over the course of their lifetime, avoid around 190 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions – a significant increase in avoided emissions over the prior year. This represents more than the equivalent emissions of the Netherlands. In contrast, our own operations and supply chain accounted for around 12 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions.
