kept up to date on projected business policies, Company planning – including financial, investment and personnel planning – and the Company ’s profitability and business operations as well as on the state of Siemens AG and the Siemens Group. We were directly involved at an early stage in all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company and discussed these decisions with the Man- aging Board intensively and in detail. To the extent that Supervisory Board approval of the decisions and mea- sures of Company management was required by law, the Siemens Articles of Association or our Bylaws, the mem- bers of the Supervisory Board – prepared in some cases by the Supervisory Board’s committees – issued such approval after intensive review and discussion.
