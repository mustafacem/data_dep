In fiscal 2023, Siemens Healthineers recorded a decrease of orders, while revenue was on the prior-year level. While the imaging and Varian businesses in particular delivered growth in both orders and revenue, this was offset by a substantial decline in the diagnostics business. On a geographic basis, revenue was on the prior-year level in all regions; in the Asia, Australia region reported revenue was held back by negative currency translation effects. Profit declined primarily due to substantially lower revenue from rapid coronavirus antigen tests in the diagnostics business, which also recorded charges of €0.2 billion related to its transformation program. In addition, profitability was burdened by impairments and other charges totaling €0.3 billion due to a management decision to refocus certain activities in the advanced therapies business. The imaging and Varian businesses increased their profit contributions on higher revenue. Severance charges were €167 million in fiscal 2023, compared to €71 million a year earlier. The order backlog for Siemens Healthineers was €34 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which €11 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2024.
