Progress on DEGREE ambition #10: Access to employee share plans â€“ maintain high level and expand globally to up to 100% by 2025

Siemens employee share program strengthens identification with the company

Employee share ownership is an integral part of the Siemens DEGREE sustainability framework: We aim to maintain access to our employee share program at the 98% level and expand it globally to up to 100% by 2025.1 Owning a stake in the company is intended to motivate our people to take personal responsibility for their own actions. This ownership culture has a long tradition at Siemens: Our first profit-sharing program was introduced back in 1858. Today the global Siemens share program, which has been offered annually since 2008, is one of the largest employee share programs in the world. More than 102,000 employees invested in their company in fis- cal 2023, which means that almost 44% of all eligible employees participated.2 In addition, Siemens AG distributed around 573,000 free bonus shares to employees in the past fiscal year as part of the global share program.
